# Curses and Verses - Poems on Swearing
## 28/09/2024

Here is a collection of poems I have written about swearing (especially habitual swearing).

### In free verse, version 1

#### Hard Edges 

```
I was taught early,
like every child, that swearing was wrong,
"Never let those words touch your tongue,"
they said, voices sweet, soft,
like the lull of bedtime stories.
I learned the script well:
Say "please," say "thank you,"
and never, ever let a curse slip out.

But now, after years of hearing the world hum
with the rhythm of proper speech,
I find truth more often in the raw edges
of those who spit fire from their mouths.
Their words, jagged and crude,
come from a place that's real,
a place where the heart bleeds openly
without the bandage of polite phrases.
When someone swears at me, in anger or pain,
I feel the sting, yes-
but I also feel the honesty.
There is no hiding there, no pretense,
just the pure, undiluted truth
that can only be spoken
when the rules are broken.

Yet, in the polished, perfect words
of those who know how to smile
and speak in tones smooth as glass,
I hear nothing but the clink of masks,
one carefully placed over another.
I think of my family,
how they sit around a table,
the air thick with secrets,
their polite exchanges a dance of deception.
They despise each other,
and yet they smile, say "How are you?"
with such practiced grace
that you could almost believe
they cared.

The irony swells like a bitter laugh in my chest-
that what we call "rude," "improper,"
is where the truth slips through,
and what we call "polite"
is where it hides.
What is worse, I wonder,
the harshness of a curse
or the emptiness of a kind word
that means nothing?

People have said all my life
that swearing shows a lack of control,
a lack of respect,
but I think now that maybe
it shows more control
than we give it credit for.
To swear is to let something out,
to let the truth crack open
through the hard surface
of what we've been taught to say.

Maybe the ones who swear
are the ones who refuse to lie.

In free verse, version 2

#### Hard Edges

```
I was taught early,
like every child, that swearing was wrong,
"Never let those words touch your tongue,"
they said, voices sweet, soft,
like the lull of bedtime stories,
sugar-coated lies meant to protect.
I learned the script well,
a litany of manners:
Say "please," say "thank you,"
and never, ever let a curse slip out,
for such words would tarnish
the innocent sparkle of childhood.

But now, after years of navigating
the landscape of polite exchanges,
I find truth hidden in the hard edges,
in the jagged syllables that tumble from lips
like fireflies in the night-
their sharpness illuminating a darkness
that polite language often conceals.
Their words, raw and unfiltered,
come from a place that's achingly real,
where hearts bleed openly,
exposed without the safe cocoon
of genteel phrases.
When someone swears at me,
in anger or frustration,
I feel the sting, yes-
but I also sense the sincerity,
the bare bones of emotion laid bare,
while the polite ones cloak their venom
in silk and smiles,
and I am left to wonder
which is the greater betrayal:
the brutal honesty of an expletive
or the hollow echo of well-mannered deceit.

Yet, amidst the polished, perfect words
of those who know how to smile
and speak in tones smooth as glass,
I hear nothing but the clink of masks,
each layer a fragile shield
hiding an ocean of resentment.
I think of my family,
gathered around a table,
the air thick with secrets and simmering anger,
their polite exchanges a choreographed
dance of deception,
each "How are you?"
a dagger wrapped in velvet.
They despise each other,
and yet they perform,
smiles painted on their faces,
the kind of smiles
that can fool the world
but never themselves.

The irony swells like a bitter laugh
caught in my throat-
that what we call "rude," "improper,"
is where the truth dares to emerge,
while what we label "polite"
is where it suffocates,
choking on its own lies.
What is worse, I wonder,
the harshness of a curse
that pierces the air like a shot,
or the emptiness of kind words
that mean nothing at all?

People have whispered all my life
that swearing shows a lack of control,
a failure to respect,
but perhaps it's the opposite;
perhaps it shows more control
than we're willing to acknowledge.
To swear is to let something raw and jagged spill out,
to let the truth crack open
through the hard shell of propriety,
to resist the urge to smooth the edges
in a world that demands gloss.

Maybe the ones who swear,
in all their messy, glorious imperfection,
are the ones who refuse to lie
about the pain we all feel,
the truth we are all too afraid to utter.
In their words, harsh yet liberating,
I find a flicker of hope,
a chance to be real in a world
that often prefers shadows.

In Rhyme

#### Hard Edges - Rhymed Version

```
I was taught early, like every child,
That swearing was wrong, so tame and mild.
"Never let those words touch your tongue,"
Voices sweet as lullabies, softly sung.
Sugar-coated lies meant to protect,
A polished facade, a world to perfect.
I learned the script, a litany of manners:
“Say 'please,' say 'thank you,' with no such scanners.”
Never let a curse slip from my lips,
For such words tarnish innocence, as it tips.

But now, after years of navigating this space,
I find truth in the hard edges I face.
In jagged syllables that tumble like sparks,
Illuminating the darkness, revealing the marks.
Their words, raw and real, flow from a place,
Where hearts bleed openly, devoid of grace.
When someone swears at me, in anger or pain,
I feel the sting, yet the honesty remains.
The polite ones cloak their venom in guise,
While beneath silk smiles, hidden anger lies.

I hear nothing but the clink of their masks,
Each layer a fragile shield, concealing their tasks.
I think of my family, gathered around,
The air thick with secrets, resentment profound.
Their polite exchanges, a dance of deceit,
Each “How are you?” a velvet-wrapped feat.
They despise each other but play their part well,
Smiles painted on faces, a truth they can't tell.

The irony swells like a bitter laugh caught,
What's called “rude” is where truth's often sought.
While what we label “polite” tends to choke,
On lies that grow thicker, a well-crafted cloak.
What's worse, I wonder, a curse that bites deep,
Or kind words that linger, empty promises to keep?

People have whispered, all through my days,
That swearing shows lack, in so many ways.
But perhaps it reveals more control than we think,
To let raw emotion spill out on the brink.
To swear is to break through the hard shell we wear,
To resist smoothing edges in a world unaware.

Maybe those who swear, in their messy embrace,
Refuse to lie about pain we all face.
In their harsh, liberating words, I find light,
A chance to be real in a world void of sight.
Where shadows conceal what we're too scared to share,
In the truth of their voices, I feel less despair.
