# Speaking in Tongues: On Being Multilingual
## 30/09/2024

Collection of poems on being multilingual.

### In free verse

#### In Between

```
I speak to my mother in Bengali,
Soft syllables of comfort and kin,
A language that reminds me of arguments and discussions,
Of sticky afternoons spent in hot summers.
But when the pages open,
The script dances in front of my eyes—
Unreadable, unreachable.
I am a guest at my own table, my own home,
A tongue that knows how to speak,
But stumbles in silence when asked to write, 
And eyes that strain to read.
My voice echoes in rooms where my hands fail,
And I wonder,
Am I truly a part of this?

In Hindi, I find friends and laughter,
Words that crackle like the streets I grew up on.
We share jokes, stories, memories—
But the language wears two faces.
In its everyday form, it feels like a second home,
But when it speaks its purest version,
"Shuddh" and sharp,
It locks me out.
I cannot follow the depth of its poetry,
The weight of its history.
I stand on the shore of it,
Watching waves of meaning I can't grasp.

English is the language I learned to be in.
In schools, in books, it is crisp and efficient,
Each word measured, clear,
A tool I've mastered,
Yet it is cold, unfeeling,
A language that belongs to everyone,
And yet no one at all.
I write in it, speak in it,
But it never speaks back.
It carries no scent of home, no pulse,
Just a hollow clarity
That tells me what to say,
But never why.

And so I linger in between,
A soul split across languages,
Each one a map to place in time and clusters of memories,
I cannot fully reach.
I am fluent in fragments,
Pieces of a whole that never come together.
I borrow words,
Shifting shapes as I speak,
Yet in every tongue,
There is something missing,
Something lost.

I belong to all of them,
And none of them, 
And none of them belong to me.
I am in between,
Forever translating.
In between tongues, in between contexts, in between memories.
```

### In Rhyme

#### In Between - Rhymed version

```
I speak in Bengali, my mother's own tongue,
Where soft words are spoken, and memories sung.
But letters on pages, they dance out of sight,
I stumble and falter, though I want to write.
A language I cherish, in voice it's my guide,
But script feels like water I can't step inside.

In Hindi, with friends, I laugh and I play,
It flows like the streets where I spent every day.
Yet "Shuddh" Hindi greets me, its borders too tight,
Its poetry distant, its meanings take flight.
I stand at its edges, unsure and alone,
In fragments I grasp it, but never full grown.

In English, I write, it's sharp and it's clear,
A language of reason, but never held dear.
I use it in school, it's a tool I command,
But it's cold as a stranger who won't take my hand.
No warmth of a home, no roots in its ground,
Just words without feeling, no echo, no sound.

Between all these worlds, I drift and I roam,
A guest in each language, but never at home.
I speak and I listen, but something feels wrong,
As if I'm just borrowing words all along.
I'm fluent in fragments, in pieces I stay,
In between voices, I wander each day.
