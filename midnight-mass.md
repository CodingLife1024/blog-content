One of the best series I have watched in recent times, which also got me started on director Mike Flanagan and his works, has been the 2021 series, Midnight Mass. 

Midnight Mass follows Riley Flynn, who returns home years later following his tragic drunk driving accident. His home is in Crockett Island, a small and close-knit island village. At the center of the town is a small church, which is suffering from a lack of church participation (which according to some characters, is bad). The village has fallen into poverty after an oil spill destroyed its fishing industry. 

Amidst the minor upheaval of his return, the local church gets a new, younger priest, Father Paul as a temporary replacement to the old (and widely understood to be senile) Father Pruitt, who is supposedly on a religious trip. Soon after his arrival, strange incidents start happening. 

A young member of the parish, Leeza, who was previously paralysed from the waist down and used a wheelchair to get around, starts to walk again. All members of the village start feeling healthier and more energised, as a result of the sacrament they do not yet know is mixed with vampire blood. There is a renewed, almost fanatical revival of the church and attendance at mass skyrockets.

Father Paul mysteriously falls ill during a meeting and miraculously revives again. Afterwards, he develops an intense dislike for sunlight and the church starts conducting mass at midnights on Sunday (hence the name Midnight Mass). 

In the penultimate episode, most of the members of the church hold a procession to the church where they plan to kill themselves with poison in an attempt to mimic Father Paul's death and subsequent revival. After some people poison themselves, they die and revive, suddenly ravenously hungry for human blood. A lot of those who weren't turned by that point are butchered and devoured by their owd friends and family. We see the newly turned vampires be devastated by the carnage that they have caused and friends and family they have killed with their own hands. It is revealed that Father Paul is actually Father Pruitt himself, turned young and healthy again after being attacked by a Creature after getting lost in a cave during his trip. 

All the buildings in the village are burned down by people attempting to kill the turned vampires with fire. As dawn approaches, it becomes evident that there is no place to shelter the Turned and they would all die once daylight arrived. We see them (well, most of them) accept this with peace and serenity. 

Only Leeza and Warren survive, and they escape by boat. As they drift farther and farther away from the shore, they see the Creature burn and die. Leeza, with a samll laugh of relief, says that she has lost feeling in her legs again, signifying the end of all that it began when it turned Father Pruitt/Paul. Since Warren and Leeza have never died and their blood wasn't contaminated enough by the Creature's blood, they are safe from the sunlight and its affects on the Turned.

Now for the major themes of the show: religious fanaticism and devotion, and how it can go terribly wrong when done badly. 

### Religious fanaticism and the Cult of Personality in Midnight Mass

The Merriam Webster Dictionary defines fanaticism as "as exhibited by excessive enthusiasm, unreasoning zeal, or wild and extravagant notions on some subject". Fanatics also tend to try to impose their views on others. This is depicted by Bev, when she tries to push Bible classes in the public school. Another example is Father Paul's action of mixing the angel's blood with the sacramental wine. As mentioned earlier, the angel's blood symbolizes the spread of fanatical ideas. His action of feeding angel blood to the people without their knowledge is an example of such forceful indoctrination. 

A binary worldview is another characteristic of fanatics (and cult members) that leads them to perceive the world in two groups. They tend to see the world in two groups as an "us" and "them". Bev showed this characteristic early on when she looks down on Riley (for his stint in jail and his past as a former alcoholic), Erin (likely for being pregnant out of wedlock), and Sheriff Hassan (for him not being a Christian). These individuals have different beliefs and experiences that Bev finds to be sinful. Father Paul initially believes that the angel can grant eternal life and save those who drink it. This leads him to subtly feed angel blood to the inhabitants as he wanted them to be a part of his flock.

The attitute of unhealthy self-sacrifice is another characteristic of fanatics. In "Midnight Mass", the inhabitants of Crocket island depicted this characteristic when they willingly drink the poison that Bev serves them. During this part of the show, the inhabitants have begun to develop blind devotion to Father Paul due to the miracles that have happened during his stay on the island. The inhabitants became fanatics and willingly commit "suicide" to show their faith. 

The last characteristic of fanaticism is putting the act of devotion over the subject of the belief. Fanatics tend to create rationalisations for their actions using holy scriptures and texts that support their beliefs. In "Midnight Mass", the inhabitants began to blindly follow the teachings of Father Paul instead of worshipping God. When the priest asks them to drink the poison to show their devotion, they willingly drank it. It showcased that the inhabitants valued the act of loyalty to Father Paul over their relationship with God. Ali, for example, was a Muslim that converts to Christianity and he tried to show his faith by drinking poison. His action is a representation of putting the act of devotion over the subject since he followed Father Paul's instructions blindly rather than developing a relationship with God.

### When Devotion Goes Wrong

Father Paul (formerly Father Pruitt) was in an illicit relationship with one of the town's residents, Mildred Gunning. This results in Mildred's illegitimate daughter, Sarah. This is the reason Bev looks down upon them. According to the show, Father Paul loved her but the couple couldn't marry due to his vows as a priest. 

In present day, Mildred suffers from dementia and is wholly dependent on her daughter. Father Paul brings the Creature back to the island with him in a misguided attempt to cure Mildred and restore her youth, as it did for him. He feeds her the sacramental wine mixed with the Creature's blood, which do improve her health and reverse her aging, but it also gets her killed in the last episode. 

His devotion towards his parishioners also leads him to feed them the contaminated wine without their consent, which does make them happier and healthier initially, but leads to the massacre of the whole town as they all start turning. He also encourages the church attendees to poison themselves as a show of faith and belief in their own revival. He makes them put their faith in him blindly over their own personal relationship with God and their faith.

His devotion to God and his faith also leads him to assume the Creature as an angel, instead of a vampire. He never stops to think if it could have any malevolent intentions and if bringing it to the island would have any ill-effects. 

### Religion is not always Fanaticism

While the story of "Midnight Mass" highlighted the dangers of fanaticism, it also aimed to differentiate the idea from religion. The Christian religion dominated the show's themes but characters like Sheriff Hassan and Riley represented different beliefs which were Islam and atheism. These characters had scenes that explained their beliefs and acted as anti-fanatical characters.

The characters of Mildred and Sarah Gunning and Erin Greene depicted authentic religious beliefs while Father Paul and his followers were religious fanatics. The former were the individuals that refused to consume the poison and turn into blood-thirsty creatures while the latter caused the tragedy that befell Crockett island. Religion understands that an individual cannot know God completely. So when Father Paul and Bev Keane began to rationalize their unethical actions by quoting scriptures, they were not practicing authentic religion but fanaticism. During the last episode, Bev Keane decided to burn all the houses on Crocket island except for the church and the recreation center. She claimed that the flame will act as the flood while the church and the recreation center will be the ark that saves the chosen. 

### The Conclusion

The pacing of Midnight Mass is a bit on the slow side, and it focuses a lot on establishing character and mood in early episodes before getting to the horror elements. Midnight Mass repeatedly uses real prayers, hymns, and Bible passages. The episodes are named after Biblical passages. To summon his demonic "angel", Paul frantically repeats the traditional Guardian Angel prayer.

> "Angel of God, my guardian dear, to whom God's love commits me here. Ever this day, be at my side, to light and guard, to rule and guide."

The last 5 minutes of the final episode are easily the most haunting scenes in the entire show. Against the background score of the hymn "Nearer, my God, to Thee", the residents gather around the beach and sing the hymn together. Father Paul/Pruitt and Mildred Gunning cradle the body of their dead daughter, as Father Paul throws away his priest's collar. Sheriff Hassan and his son Ali are seen doing namaaz on the beach as they face the certainty of their death. Their silhouettes fade away against the rising sun. Leeza and Warren float along the sea in their boat. Couples slow dance and kiss as the sun comes up and turns them all to ash.
