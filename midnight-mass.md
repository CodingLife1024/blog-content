Midnight Mass follows Riley Flynn, who is returning home years later following his tragic drunk driving accident. His home is in Crockett Island, a small and close-knit island village. At the center of the town is a small church, which is suffering from a lack of church participation (which according to some characters, is bad). His return after years of absence sets off a chain of events that set off the deep-seated tensions within the community. 

Amidst the minor upheaval of his return, the local church gets a new, younger priest, Father Paul as a temporary replacement to the old (and widely understood to be senile) Father Pruitt, who is supposedly on a religious trip. Soon after his arrival, strange incidents start happening. 

A young member of the parish, Leeza, who was previously paralysed from the waist down and used a wheelchair to get around, starts to walk again. All members of the village start feeling healthier and more energised, as a result of the sacrament they do not yet know is vampire blood. There is a renewed, almost fanatical revival of the church and attendance at mass skyrockets.

Father Paul mysteriously falls ill during a meeting and miraculously revives again. Afterwards, he develops an intense dislike for sunlight and the church starts conducting mass at midnights on Sunday (hence the name of the show, Midnight Mass). 

 In the penultimate episode, most of the members of the church hold a procession to the church where they plan to kill themselves with poison in an attempt to mimic Father Paul's death and subsequent revival. After some people poison themselves, they die and revive, suddenly ravenously hungry for human blood. A lot of those who weren't turned by that point are butchered and devoured by their owd friends and family. We see the newly turned vampires be devastated by the carnage that they have caused and friends and family they have killed with their own hands. It is revealed that Father Paul is actually Father Pruitt himself, turned young and healthy again after being attacked by a Creature after getting lost in a cave during his trip. 

 All the buildings in the village are burned down by people attempting to kill the turned vampires with fire. As dawn approaches, it becomes evident that there is no place to shelter the Turned and they would all die once daylight arrived. We see them (well, most of them) accept this with peace and serenity. 

 Only Leeza and Warren survive, and they escape by boat. As they drift farther and farther away from the shore, they see the Creature burn and die. Leeza, with a samll laugh of relief, says that she has lost feeling in her legs again, signifying the end of all that it began when it turned Father Pruitt/Paul. Since Warren and Leeza have never died and their blood wasn't contaminated enough by the Creature's blood, they are safe from the sunlight and its affects on the Turned.

Now for the major themes of the show: religious fanaticism and devotion, and how it can go terribly wrong when done badly. 

### Religious fanaticism in Midnight Mass

The Merriam Webster Dictionary defines fanaticism as "as exhibited by excessive enthusiasm, unreasoning zeal, or wild and extravagant notions on some subject". Fanatics also tend to try to impose their views on others. This is depicted by Bev, when she tries to push Bible classes in the public school. Another example is Father Paul’s action of mixing the angel's blood with the sacramental wine. As mentioned earlier, the angel’s blood symbolizes the spread of fanatical ideas. His action of feeding angel blood to the people without their consent is a depiction of forceful indoctrination. 

A dualistic worldview is another characteristic of fanatics (and cult members) that leads them to perceive the world in two divisions. They tend to see the world in two groups as an "us" and "others". Bev showed this characteristic early on when she looks down on Riley, Erin, and Sheriff Hassan. These individuals have different beliefs and experiences that Bev found to be sinful in the eyes of the Lord. Father Paul initially believed that the angel can grant eternal life and save those who drink it while those who refuse may suffer. This leads him to subtly feed angel blood to the inhabitants as he wanted them to be a part of his flock.

The fanaticism characteristic of unhealthy self-sacrifice is the most common characteristic of fanatics. In “Midnight Mass”, the inhabitants of Crocket island depicted this characteristic when they willingly drank the poison that Bev served them. During this part of the show, the inhabitants have begun to develop blind devotion to Father Paul due to the miracles that have happened during his stay on the island. The inhabitants became fanatics and willingly committed self-intoxication to show their faith. 

The last characteristic of fanaticism is putting the act of devotion over the subject of the belief. Fanatics tend to create rationalizations for their actions using holy scriptures, testimonies, and other texts that they associate with their beliefs. In “Midnight Mass”, the inhabitants began to blindly follow the teachings of Father Paul instead of worshipping God. When the priest asked them to drink the poison to show their devotion, it showcased that the inhabitants value the act of loyalty over their relationship with God. Ali, for example, was a Muslim that converted to Christianity and he tried to show his faith by drinking poison. His action is a perfect representation of putting the act of devotion over the subject since he followed Father Paul’s instructions rather than developing a relationship with God.

### When Devotion Goes Wrong

Father Paul (formerly Father Pruitt) was in an illicit relationship with one of the town's residents, Mildred Gunning. This results in Mildred's illegitimate daughter, Sarah. This is the reason Bev looks down upon them. According to the show, Father Paul loved her but the couple couldn't marry due to his vows. 

In present day, Mildred suffers from dementia and is wholly dependent on her daughter. Father Paul brings the Creature back to the island with him in a misguided attempt to cure Mildred and restore her youth, as it did for him.
