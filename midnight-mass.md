Midnight Mass follows Riley Flynn, who is returning home years later following his tragic drunk driving accident. His home is in Crockett Island, a small and close-knit island village. At the center of the town is a small church, which is suffering from a lack of church participation (which according to some characters, is bad). His return after years of absence sets off a chain of events that set off the deep-seated tensions within the community. 

Amidst the minor upheaval of his return, the local church gets a new, younger priest, Father Paul as a temporary replacement to the old (and widely understood to be senile) Father Pruitt, who is supposedly on a religious trip. Soon after his arrival, strange incidents start happening. 

A young member of the parish, Leeza, who was previously paralysed from the waist down and used a wheelchair to get around, starts to walk again. All members of the village start feeling healthier and more energised, as a result of the sacrament they do not yet know is vampire blood. There is a renewed, almost fanatical revival of the church and attendance at mass skyrockets.

Father Paul mysteriously falls ill during a meeting and miraculously revives again. Afterwards, he develops an intense dislike for sunlight and the church starts conducting mass at midnights on Sunday (hence the name of the show, Midnight Mass). 

 In the penultimate episode, most of the members of the church hold a procession to the church where they plan to kill themselves with poison in an attempt to mimic Father Paul's death and subsequent revival. After some people poison themselves, they die and revive, suddenly ravenously hungry for human blood. A lot of those who weren't turned by that point are butchered and devoured by their owd friends and family. We see the newly turned vampires be devastated by the carnage that they have caused and friends and family they have killed with their own hands. It is revealed that Father Paul is actually Father Pruitt himself, turned young and healthy again after being attacked by a Creature after getting lost in a cave during his trip. 

 All the buildings in the village are burned down by people attempting to kill the turned vampires with fire. As dawn approaches, it becomes evident that there is no place to shelter the Turned and they would all die once daylight arrived. We see them (well, most of them) accept this with peace and serenity. 

 Only Leeza and Warren survive, and they escape by boat. As they drift farther and farther away from the shore, they see the Creature burn and die. Leeza, with a samll laugh of relief, says that she has lost feeling in her legs again, signifying the end of all that it began when it turned Father Pruitt/Paul. Since Warren and Leeza have never died and their blood wasn't contaminated enough by the Creature's blood, they are safe from the sunlight and its affects on the Turned.
