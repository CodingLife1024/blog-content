Midnight Mass follows Riley Flynn, who is returning home years later following his tragic drunk driving accident. His home is in Crockett Island, a small and close-knit island village. At the center of the town is a small church, which is suffering from a lack of church participation (which according to some characters, is bad). His return after years of absence sets off a chain of events that set off the deep-seated tensions within the community. 

Amidst the minor upheaval of his return, the local church gets a new, younger priest, Father Paul as a temporary replacement to the old (and widely suspected to be senile) Father Pruitt, who is supposedly on a religious trip.
