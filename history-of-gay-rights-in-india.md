# A History of Gay Rights in India
## 23/04/2024

### The Beginning (1992)

India’s first-ever protests demanding rights for gay individuals happened on August 11, 1992. It was held by the AIDS Bhedbhav Virodhi Andolan (ABVA) outside ITO Police headquarters in Delhi to protest the arrest of men from Central Park in Connaught Place on the suspicion of homosexuality. In those days, this kind of harassment was still a 'normal' practice.

That same year, ABVA filed a PIL in the Delhi High Court challenging the constitutional validity of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, widely considered one of the first legal protests against government repression of LGBTQ rights in India. It was dismissed in 2001. Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, a Victorian relic, criminalised sex "against the order of nature."

### India's HIV Crisis

By 2002, India’s HIV-affected population was placed by the government at around 3.97 million — second only to South Africa. While the country’s homosexual community was ravaged by the epidemic, police continued to harass members if they came forward for treatment.

### Delhi High Court Verdict (2009)

India’s gay community repeatedly mounted legal challenges post its failure in 1994. In 2009, the Delhi High Court held in Naz Foundation vs Govt. of NCT Delhi that treating gay sex between consenting adults as a crime was a gross violation of the fundamental right to privacy enshrined in the Indian Constitution.

### Supreme Court Reversal (2013)

However, in 2013, the Supreme Court overturned the Delhi High Court's ruling in Suresh Kumar Koushal vs Naz Foundation.

### Private Member Bills to Decriminalise Homosexuality

In 2015, MP Shashi Tharoor introduced a private member's bill in the Lok Sabha seeking to decriminalize homosexuality by amending Section 377 of the IPC. But it failed to pass in the Lok Sabha. Again, in March 2016, the Lok Sabha voted against the introduction of Tharoor's Indian Penal Code (Amendment) Bill 2016 to amend Section 377— the second time in three months.

### Final Decriminalization (2018)

In 2017, the Supreme Court, in a seminal judgement, ruled that privacy was a fundamental right for individuals under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution, in Justice K. S. Puttaswamy vs. Union of India.

This set a judicial precedent that helped the legal battles of the LGBTQ community. On September 6, 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that Section 377 was unconstitutional "in so far as it criminalises consensual sexual conduct between adults of the same sex", thus legalising "consensual same-sex acts between homosexuals, heterosexuals, lesbians and other sexual minorities."

In a historic and unanimous judgment, the Supreme Court of India decriminalised Section 377 of the IPC, in a verdict handed down by a five-judge Constitutional Bench on September 06, 2018.

### Social Progress Through Pride 

On a social front, India held its first pride parade, incidentally also South Asia's first, on July 2, 1999, in Kolkata— called the Kolkata Rainbow Pride Walk. Pride events have now been held in over 21 Indian cities. Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore saw their first pride parades in 2008, and Bhubaneswar and Chennai followed suit in 2009. Kerala’s first march was in 2010 and Pune in 2011. Guwahati was the first to hold a Pride Parade in the Northeast in 2014.

### Post Decriminalisation in 2018

Post the legalisation of same-sex relationships, marriage has been the next battlefront for the community. In India, multiple cases have been filed before High Courts seeking the recognition of same-sex marriages under the Hindu Marriage Act, the Special Marriage Act and the Foreign Marriage Act.

In November 2022, two gay couples filed writ petitions in the Supreme Court seeking legal recognition of same-sex marriages, under the Special Marriage Act, 1954. 

Similar petitions pending before the Delhi and Kerala High Courts have now been transferred to the Supreme Court. A Constitution Bench began hearing the matter in April 2023, and post a 10-day hearing, the Court has now reserved its judgement. The Union government has been firm in stating that the decriminalisation of same-sex relationships does not signify acceptance of same-sex marriage and that this is not in line with Indian society. It has urged the Supreme Court to leave the matter to the Parliament.  

In June 2022, the Kerala High Court set a precedent by allowing a lesbian couple to live together after they were forcibly separated by their parents. The Court simply asked the couple if they wished to live together, to which they replied with a 'yes.'

### On Conversion Therapy

India has also made progress on conversion therapy - a blanket term used for a number of ways, often coercive, used to treat a person attracted to the same sex or of alternate gender identity, to make them cisgender and/or heterosexual. It can include the use of psychiatric treatment, drugs, exorcism and even violence. According to AACAP, conversion therapy may exacerbate mental health conditions, like anxiety, stress and drug use, sometimes leading to suicide.

On August 25, 2022 the National Medical Commission (NMC), the apex regulatory body of medical professionals in India, wrote to all State Medical Councils, banning conversion therapy and calling it "professional misconduct". In a letter dated August 25, it also empowered the State bodies to take disciplinary action against medical professionals who breach the guideline. 

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the history of gay rights in India is interwoven with struggles, triumphs, setbacks, and resilience. From the shadows of criminalization to the light of legal recognition, the LGBTQ+ community has traversed a long and arduous path toward equality.
