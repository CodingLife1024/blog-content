This is the second part of the Book Summary

### The Rules

#### 2. Embrace Boredom

Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don't simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction. Much in the same way that athletes must take care of their bodies outside of their training sessions, you'll struggle to achieve the deepest levels of concentration if you spend the rest of your time fleeing the slightest hint of boredom.

"_So we have scales that allow us to divide up people into people who multitask all the time and people who rarely do, and the differences are remarkable. People who multitask all the time can't filter out irrelevancy. They can't manage a working memory. They're chronically distracted. They initiate much larger parts of their brain that are irrelevant to the task at hand...they're pretty much mental wrecks._"

##### 1. Don't Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus.

Instead of scheduling the occasional break from distraction so you can focus, you should instead schedule the occasional break from focus to give in to distraction.

1. **Point #1: This strategy works even if your job requires lots of Internet use and/or prompt e-mail replies.** - 

If you're required to spend hours every day online or answer e-mails quickly, that's fine: This simply means that your Internet blocks will be more numerous than those of someone whose job requires less connectivity. The total number or duration of your Internet blocks doesn't matter nearly as much as making sure that the integrity of your offline blocks remains intact.

2. **Point #2: Regardless of how you schedule your Internet blocks, you must keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from Internet use.** - 

This objective is easy to state in principle but quickly becomes tricky in the messyreality of the standard workday. An inevitable issue you'll face when executing this strategy is realizing early on in an offline block that there's some crucial piece of information online that you need to retrieve to continue making progress on your current task. If your next Internet block doesn't start for a while, you might end up stuck. The temptation in this situation is to quickly give in, look up the information, then return to your offline block. You must resist this temptation! The Internet is seductive: You may think you're just retrieving a single key e-mail from your inbox, but you'll find it hard to not glance at the other "urgent" messages that have recently arrived.

It's crucial in this situation, therefore, that you don't immediately abandon an offline block, even when stuck. If it's possible, switch to another offline activity for the remainder of the current block (or perhaps even fill in this time relaxing). If this is infeasible - perhaps you need to get the current offline activity done promptly - then the correct response is to change your schedule so that your next Internet block begins sooner. The key in making this change, however, is to not schedule the next Internet block to occur immediately. Instead, enforce at least a five-minute gap between the current moment and the next time you can go online.

3. **Point #3: Scheduling Internet use at home as well as at work can further improve your concentration training.** - 

If you find yourself glued to a smartphone or laptop throughout your evenings and weekends, then it's likely that your behavior outside of work is undoing many of your attempts during the workday to rewire your brain.

Schedule lots of long Internet blocks. The key here isn't to avoid or even to reduce the total amount of time you spend engaging in distracting behavior, but is instead to give yourself plenty of opportunities throughout your evening to resist switching to these distractions at the slightest hint of boredom.

To simply wait and be bored has become a novel experience in modern life, but from the perspective of concentration training, it's incredibly valuable.
