# Virtuous Villains: Villains who were Sort of Justified in their Actions

### Carrie (Carrie)

Not saying that Carrie White was justified in burinng down the entire town and killing her mother (and probably a fair number of innocent bystanders as well), but life hadn't treated her very well at that point. She was abused by her hyper-religious mother, severely bullied and socially outcast by her classmates (in a way only 2000s movies will depict) and all this was ignored by her teachers and other acquaintances. Nobody helped her much during any of her struggles. 

When she gets humiliated at prom by having pig's blood poured on her as a prank, she goes on a rampage throughout the town and the people who had contributed, however insignificantly to her anguish. 

She does kill innocent people while on the telekinetic rampage and this is not in self-defence either. Carrie's rampage is comparable to a school shooting, where kids who are socially outcast often carry out these massacres.

Plus, Carrie's mother _did_ stab her.

### Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)

Most of us would agree that the solution to overpopulation is _not_ mass murder. However Thanos is not a native earth-dweller. From his point of view, he was trying to reduce human (and all other living creature) suffering by reducing the demand of natural resources and space. There is, after all, no dearth of pain, suffering and scarcity on earth.  

However, we are a constantly evolving species. We can solve the scarcity of natural resources through technology (this has to be possible in MCU, where Tony Stark built a working model of the Iron Man suit from what was basically scrap metal. In captivity, too.) 

Also, if this were not true, halving the population would only be a temporary solution to the "problem". 

Why couldn't Thanos have snapped us into infinite space and resources?

### Frankenstein's Monster (Frankenstein)

In both the book and the films, Frankenstein's monster goes on a rampage and kills numerous people close to his creator, who had nothing to do with his misery or the experiment. He follows around Dr. Frankenstein and threatens and terrorises him till the end of his life. In searching for the monster to exact revenge, Victor Frankenstein dies of exhaustion.

In his defense, he was right in wanting his creator to take responsibility for him. He was basically abandoned at birth(?) and given no tools to survive among humans. He was also made to be hideous and large which caused him to be ostracised by many people. Also, he was the only kind of his species, which musthave contributed to his rage at his creator, especially after he destroys the body of his companion after building it. 

We could argue that Victor Frankenstein was the true villain, as his actions (creating and giving life to the monster without taking responsibility for it) caused the death of manyof his friends and family, as they came in the path of his creation's rage towards himself.

### Doctor Frankenstein (Frankenstein)

In a partial continuation of the previous argument, even Victor Frankenstein can be defended as he was trying to advance science and medicine by creating completely new life in his monster.

He definitely was callous and irresponsible in how he treated his own creation, and he paid a heavy price for it. He never took any responsibility for the life he himself created knowingly and willingly, and made it look hideous and never taught him how to survive in the world.

### Light Yagami: Death Note

![yagami](https://github.com/CodingLife1024/blog-content/blob/main/images/vv5.jpg?raw=true)

In his defense, we could argue that he was trying to rid his country (and the world in general) of crime. What he does is basically vigilante justice, and he was careful to only kill the people convicted of the worst crimes (initially). Crime did drop off a while after Light Yagami killed criminals with relative impunity. 

However, vigilante justice never works out well when an individual is the one calling the shots. He is bound to get some wrong. In the pursuit of his "justice", he kill several people who are involved in the Kira investigation who had not done any criminal activities, including his own father. 

Also, his method of killing allowed him to kill without directly doing anything, which likely partially absolved the guilt that one would feel on killing someone with their own hands. At the end, he had become one of the same serial killers that he despised enough to want to rid the world of them. He killed his father and some of his colleagues, and betrayed them by doing so.
