### Carrie (Carrie)

Not saying that Carrie White was justified in burinng down the entire town and killing her mother (and probably a fair number of innocent bystanders as well), but life hadn't treated her very well at that point. She was abused by her hyper-religious mother, severely bullied and socially outcast by her classmates (in a way only 2000s movies will depict) and all this was ignored by her teachers and other acquaintances. Nobody helped her much during any of her struggles. 

When she gets humiliated at prom by having pig's blood poured on her as a prank, she goes on a rampage throughout the town and the people who had contributed, however insignificantly to her anguish. 

She does kill innocent people while on the telekinetic rampage and this is not in self-defence either. Carrie's rampage is comparable to a school shooting, where kids who are socially outcast often carry out these massacres.

Plus, Carrie's mother _did_ stab her.

### Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)

Most of us would agree that the solution to overpopulation is _not_ mass murder. However Thanos is not a native earth-dweller. From his point of view, he was trying to reduce human (and all other living creature) suffering by reducing the demand of natural resources and space. There is, after all, no dearth of pain, suffering and scarcity on earth.  

However, we are a constantly evolving species. We can solve the scarcity of natural resources through technology (this has to be possible in MCU, where Tony Stark built a working model of the Iron Man suit from what was basically scrap metal. In captivity, too.) 

Also, if this were not true, halving the population would only be a temporary solution to the "problem". 

Why couldn't Thanos have snapped us into infinite space and resources?
