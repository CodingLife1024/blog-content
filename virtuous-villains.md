# Virtuous Villains: Villains who were Sort of Justified in their Actions
## 21/03/2024

Most of the fictional villains cause a lot of pain and suffering on screen. But some of the do occassionally get the right idea (and execute it wrongly). 

### Carrie (Carrie)

Not saying that Carrie White was justified in burinng down the entire town and killing her mother (and probably a fair number of innocent bystanders as well), but life hadn't treated her very well at that point. She was abused by her hyper-religious mother, severely bullied and socially outcast by her classmates (in a way only 2000s movies will depict) and all this was ignored by her teachers and other acquaintances. Nobody helped her much during any of her struggles. 

When she gets humiliated at prom by having pig's blood poured on her as a prank, she goes on a rampage throughout the town and the people who had contributed, however insignificantly to her anguish. 

She does kill innocent people while on the telekinetic rampage and this is not in self-defence either. Carrie's rampage is comparable to a school shooting, where kids who are socially outcast often carry out these massacres.

Plus, Carrie's mother _did_ stab her.

### Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)

Most of us would agree that the solution to overpopulation is _not_ mass murder. However Thanos is not a native earth-dweller. From his point of view, he was trying to reduce human (and all other living creature) suffering by reducing the demand of natural resources and space. There is, after all, no dearth of pain, suffering and scarcity on earth.  

However, we are a constantly evolving species. We can solve the scarcity of natural resources through technology (this has to be possible in MCU, where Tony Stark built a working model of the Iron Man suit from what was basically scrap metal. In captivity, too.) 

Also, if this were not true, halving the population would only be a temporary solution to the "problem". 

Why couldn't Thanos have snapped us into infinite space and resources?

### Frankenstein's Monster (Frankenstein)

In both the book and the films, Frankenstein's monster goes on a rampage and kills numerous people close to his creator, who had nothing to do with his misery or the experiment. He follows around Dr. Frankenstein and threatens and terrorises him till the end of his life. In searching for the monster to exact revenge, Victor Frankenstein dies of exhaustion.

In his defense, he was right in wanting his creator to take responsibility for him. He was basically abandoned at birth(?) and given no tools to survive among humans. He was also made to be hideous and large which caused him to be ostracised by many people. Also, he was the only kind of his species, which musthave contributed to his rage at his creator, especially after he destroys the body of his companion after building it. 

We could argue that Victor Frankenstein was the true villain, as his actions (creating and giving life to the monster without taking responsibility for it) caused the death of manyof his friends and family, as they came in the path of his creation's rage towards himself.

### Doctor Frankenstein (Frankenstein)

In a partial continuation of the previous argument, even Victor Frankenstein can be defended as he was trying to advance science and medicine by creating completely new life in his monster.

He definitely was callous and irresponsible in how he treated his own creation, and he paid a heavy price for it. He never took any responsibility for the life he himself created knowingly and willingly, and made it look hideous and never taught him how to survive in the world.

### Light Yagami: Death Note

In his defense, we could argue that he was trying to rid his country (and the world in general) of crime. What he does is basically vigilante justice, and he was careful to only kill the people convicted of the worst crimes (initially). Crime did drop off a while after Light Yagami killed criminals with relative impunity. 

However, vigilante justice never works out well when an individual is the one calling the shots. He is bound to get some wrong. In the pursuit of his "justice", he kill several people who are involved in the Kira investigation who had not done any criminal activities, including his own father. 

Also, his method of killing allowed him to kill without directly doing anything, which likely partially absolved the guilt that one would feel on killing someone with their own hands. At the end, he had become one of the same serial killers that he despised enough to want to rid the world of them. He killed his father and some of his colleagues, and betrayed them by doing so. 

### Parker Crane (Insidious: Chapter 2)

![Parker Crane](https://github.com/CodingLife1024/blog-content/blob/main/images/vv6.jpg?raw=true)

Parker Crane was severely abused by his mother Michelle from his childhood. His mother forced him to deny his own name, Parker, which was given to him by his father and forced the name "Marilyn" onto him and made him wear feminine clothing. This caused him to have issues with his gender as a man and he turned to killing women (for his mother) dressed in bridal attire (hence, "The Bride in Black"). Even after Michelle's death, she continued to influence him and his killings from across the veil as "Mater Mortis" (Mother of Death). Parker Crane literally had no peace, either in life or in death, either his or his mother's. He only (maybe) gets peace when Mater Mortis is eradicated from the further and he just fades away. His mother's spirit had been keeping him tethered to the Further. In the further, child Parker helps Elise destroy Michelle's memories and save the Lambert family, because he just wanted to have a normal childhood and Elise convinces him that helping her would help him get that. 

This is not to say that what Parker did in life and death is inexcusable. He killed several women dressed as the Bride in Black at his mother's behest and never got out of her clutches even as an adult. 

### Killmonger (Marvel Cinematic Universe)

### Gorr, the God Butcher (Marvel Cinematic Universe, Thor: Love and Thunder)

![Gorr](https://github.com/CodingLife1024/blog-content/blob/main/images/vv8.jpg?raw=true)

In the MCU, Gorr is an intergalactic being who seeks to kill all the gods in all the universes to see his vision of a universe without gods being a reality. He was wrong in kidnapping thr children of New Asgard to do this. 

However, when Gorr was human, he watched his daughter die in his arms. He then encounters Rapu, who is the god he believes in and is devoted to. Rapu has no compassion for Gorr and mocks his religious fervor. Not only could this god not care less about his followers, but he informs Gorr that the afterlife he believed he was working towards - and where he would be reunited with his daughter - doesnâ€™t exist. 

He realises that the gods do not care about them and that all the human suffering in the world does not have any meaning. The movie could have gone this way: Gorr uses his wish to resurrect his daughter instead of going after all the gods in the universe. But this would go against what Gorr stands for. He genuinely believes that killing all the gods would help all beings in the universe. He is not doing it for himself or his daughter, he is doing it for everyone. Because he is not selfish.
