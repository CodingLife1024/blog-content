### Carrie (Carrie)

Not saying that Carrie White was justified in burinng down the entire town and killing her mother (and probably a fair number of innocent bystanders as well), but life hadn't treated her very well at that point. She was abused by her hyper-religious mother, severely bullied and socially outcast by her classmates (in a way only 2000s movies will depict) and all this was ignored by her teachers and other acquaintances. Nobody helped her much during any of her struggles. 

When she gets humiliated at prom by having pig's blood poured on her as a prank, she goes on a rampage throughout the town and the people who had contributed, however insignificantly to her anguish. 

She does kill innocent people while on the telekinetic rampage and this is not in self-defence either. Carrie's rampage is comparable to a school shooting, where kids who are socially outcast often carry out these massacres.

Plus, Carrie's mother _did_ stab her.
