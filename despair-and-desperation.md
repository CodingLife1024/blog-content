#### I Swear

```
\begin{verse}
I swear, I'll do anything—no, really, anything you ask, \\
if it keeps you here just a little longer, just one more night. \\
I'll hold back every word, every ache that spills out without asking, \\
swallow down this loneliness that swells, desperate to be seen. \\
I know I wear you down, cling too tight, let my sadness spill over, \\
but I've never learned how to be alone without disappearing, \\
never learned how to stand without someone to hold me up. \\

If I promise to be quiet, to lock every broken piece away— \\
could you stay, please? I'll bury my fear, I'll hide the worst of me, \\
I'll be the friend who smiles, nods, doesn't talk about himself. \\
I'll laugh at all the jokes, pretend I don't feel myself fading, \\
if it means you won't go. \\

I swear, I can change. I'll be lighter, softer, someone you don't tire of, \\
someone who isn't so small, so sad, so hungry for the kind of love \\
that feels less like pity. I know you feel the weight of me; I know it's too much. \\
I just don't know how to let go, don't know how to be whole on my own. \\

So please, just for now, be the thread I hold on to, \\
the one place I don't feel like a burden, the last piece of light \\
in a life that's just rooms filled with silence. I swear I won't be this way forever. \\
I just need you not to leave, to stay, even if it's only out of kindness— \\
even if it's only until I learn not to need you to breathe. \\
\end{verse}

### Free Verse, Version 2

#### I Swear

\begin{verse}
I swear, I'll find a way to be the friend you want, a version of me you don't mind keeping around— \\
I'll tuck my pain into corners, lock every sadness away like it never mattered. \\
I know you're tired of hearing the same story, tired of me filling every silence \\
with everything I can't keep inside. I see the way you flinch, the way your eyes wander, \\
looking for an escape, a clean exit out of this messy, too-heavy thing I've become. \\

I swear, I'll pretend I don't see it, that I don't feel you pulling away, \\
slipping out of reach, inch by inch, like you're running from a fire I can't seem to put out. \\
I swear, I'll be different. I'll fold my fears into my pockets, \\
I'll swallow the sadness that claws at my throat just to sit with you, \\
silent, harmless, like a shadow that doesn't demand to be seen. \\

Just—please—don't go. I know it's pathetic to beg like this, \\
to cling to someone who's already half gone, who's already exhausted, \\
but you're the last bit of light left in a world that's darkened beyond what I can bear. \\
I'll be quieter, smaller, someone who doesn't need to be held up, \\
someone who knows how to stand without leaning. I swear I can learn. \\

I know I've made you my lifeline, that I'm suffocating you with all I can't fix in myself, \\
that I look to you like you're the only way out of this, like you're the cure \\
to something you never signed up to heal. I see it every time you wince, \\
every time you sigh, worn thin under the weight I've piled on. \\

I swear, I'll be someone else, someone lighter, someone who doesn't beg, \\
doesn't look at you like you're the last bit of air in a drowning world. \\
I'll be a version of myself that doesn't ache so openly, \\
doesn't wear his heartbreak like a coat he can't take off. \\
I'll hide it better, bury it deeper, I swear I'll learn to be less. \\

I know it's too much to ask, that staying with me is like standing in quicksand, \\
that every time you turn away it's because I'm dragging you down. \\
But I've never known how to hold onto anything that didn't slip away, \\
never learned how to be whole without someone to anchor me, \\
someone to keep me from falling apart entirely. \\

So, please, I'm begging—don't leave. Stay, if only out of pity, if only because I swear \\
I'll hold all my broken pieces out of sight, out of mind, \\
I'll be someone you don't have to worry about, someone you don't resent for needing too much. \\
Let me hold onto you just a little longer, \\
until I learn not to need you to feel like I'm worth something, \\
until I find a way to exist without you filling every hollow place inside me. \\

I swear, I'll do anything, I'll change in ways you never asked me to, \\
I'll be quieter, softer, more like the person you thought I was— \\
if it means I don't have to let you go, if it means I don't have to face \\
the silence of being completely, truly alone. \\
\end{verse}

### Free Verse, Version 3

#### I Swear

\begin{verse}
I swear, \\
this time I'll be quiet, \\
hold back the flood of all the things I cannot say, \\
the ones that claw to get out and settle heavy, \\
make the air hard to breathe. \\
I swear, \\
I'll tuck my hurts away, my fears down deep, \\
fold them into the lines on my face, \\
the bags under my eyes, my shaking hands. \\

Just don't go. \\
Please, stay here, let me hold this last thread \\
while everything else unravels. \\
I know the weight I carry spills onto your shoulders, \\
it's too much, too often, I know. \\
But you— \\
you are the only one who sees, \\
even as you turn your face away. \\

I swear, \\
I'll bury it all down; I'll lock it away, \\
I won't let it reach you. \\
I'll be the friend you need, \\
someone who won't drown you in his tides, \\
someone whose hands don't shake as he clings, \\
begging for you not to go. \\
\end{verse}
