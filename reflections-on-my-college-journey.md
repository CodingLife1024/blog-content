# Reflections on my College Journey: As a Final year student
## 26/07/2024 

I started writing this blog entry on the first day of my final year of college. As I sit in my hostel room, the familiar surroundings suddenly seem to carry a heavy sense of nostalgia and reflection. This final year marks the culmination of countless experiences, friendships, and lessons learned within these walls. Hostel life has been an incredible journey, filled with highs and lows, and as I begin this entry, I find myself thinking about the unique blend of pros and cons that have defined my years here. 

The thought of leaving the hostel fills me with a deep sense of sadness. This place has been my home and the backdrop to countless memories. The late-night conversations, shared meals, and adventures with friends have created bonds that are hard to leave behind. The sense of community and belonging that hostel life provides is something truly special, and the thought of moving on from this chapter is bittersweet.
