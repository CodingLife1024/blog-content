# Reflections on my College Journey: As a Final year student
## 29/07/2024 

I started writing this blog entry on the first day of my final year of college. As I sit in my hostel room, the familiar surroundings suddenly seem to carry a heavy sense of nostalgia and reflection. This final year marks the culmination of countless experiences, friendships, and lessons learned within these walls. 

### Hostel Life: A Journey of Growth

Hostel life has been an incredible journey, filled with highs and lows, and as I begin this entry, I find myself thinking about the unique blend of pros and cons that have defined my years here. 

The thought of leaving the hostel fills me with a deep sense of sadness. This place has been my home and the backdrop to countless memories. The late-night conversations, shared meals, and adventures with friends have created bonds that are hard to leave behind. The sense of community and belonging that hostel life provides is something truly special, and the thought of moving on from this chapter is bittersweet.

When I came to campus in 2021 (in my 2nd semester), we were assigned rooms in Indraprashtha Hostel. Living alone(-ish) was a big change after living with my parents all my life. At first I was a bit overwhelmed with handling the different tasks (regular house chores, academics, social life, etc). I learned to prioritise the tasks and what was important and what was not (for example, it wasn't necessary to sweep the floor everyday, and washing clothes every alternate week suffices).

From my 3rd semester onwards, I have lived in Himadri Hostel. Here, I was much closer to my seniors, and they helped me out with academics and life. My seniors played a pivotal role during this time, guiding me through academic challenges and offering invaluable life advice. The pink walls, now as familiar as my own home, witnessed my journey from a hesitant faccha to a confident senior. I cannot count the number of times I have cried on the shoulder of a senior dues to academic stress or other life issues. 

The late-night conversations in the hostel corridors and rooms, where we discussed everything from academic issues and politics to future plans, are memories I will always think back fondly. 

Another highlight has been the outings with friends. Exploring the city and participating in various events added a layer of excitement and spontaneity to my college life. These experiences have not only been fun but also taught me the importance of balancing work and life.

### Academic Pursuits: Lessons Beyond the Classroom

My first semester as a college student was spent at home (thanks, lockdown). I was absolutely not prepared for college-style academics. Suddenly, previous years' papers weren't so useful in tackling exams. Exams seemed much too hard compared to the class study material. 

Since the semester exams was online, there was massive large scale cheating. This inflated the average scores of all all exams. Overall, that semester was a nightmare. We also missed out on a lot of extra-curriculars and events. 

After that semester we were quickly onboarded (Even the professors were relieved at the prospect of conducting exams in a more honest and controlled environment).

Returning to campus was a breath of fresh air. The shift from virtual to in-person classes brought with it a renewed sense of engagement and motivation. One of the major benefits of on-campus learning was access to academic support and resources.

With the reopening of campus, extracurricular activities and events started back up. Managing my time between academics, extracurriculars, and social life became crucial. I learned the importance of discipline and effective time management. The experience of living independently taught me responsibility and self-reliance.

While on-campus learning brought many positives, it also came with its own set of challenges. Balancing a demanding academic schedule with extracurricular commitments was often stressful. However, these challenges pushed me to develop better organizational skills and resilience.

Reflecting on my academic journey, I realize how much I have grown since my first semester. The initial hurdles and subsequent experiences have shaped my approach to learning and problem-solving. As I move forward into my final year, I carry with me the lessons learned and the confidence gained from overcoming obstacles.

### The Impact of College on Identity and Beliefs

I have met and made connections with so many different people with different backgrounds, personalities and interests.  

The dynamic environment has played a crucial role in my personal growth. I have learned to navigate complex social situations, develop meaningful connections, and handle conflicts with maturity. These experiences have strengthened my interpersonal skills and made me more adaptable and resilient. 

### Conclusion

My college journey has been a blend of academic rigor and personal growth. From the challenges of online learning to the rewarding experience of being back on campus, each phase has contributed to my development as a student and an individual. As I embark on my final year, I am grateful for the experiences that have prepared me for the future and look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.
