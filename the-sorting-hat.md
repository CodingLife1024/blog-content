# Harry Potter: The Sorting Hat
## 26/02/2024

Like many long time fans of the Harry Potter series, I have been fascinated by the Sorting Hat and its thought process in categorising students in different houses. There are 4 houses in Harry Potter lore - Gryffindor (for courage and bravery), Hufflepuff (for kindness and hardwork), Ravenclaw (for wisdom and intellect) and Slytherin (for cunning and shrewdness). These houses are integral to J. K. Rowlings' magical Universe. All students are sorted into one of the 4 houses when they come into their first year.

Yet, upon closer examination, it becomes evident that the Sorting Hat's methodology is not as straightforward as it may initially seem. There is plenty that is wrong with this system. When the new students come to Hogwarts, they are _11 years old_. Their personalities haven't been fully formed yet. 

Does the hat take their personality _at the time of sorting_ as a parameter? This seems to be false, as at the time of sorting, Neville Longbottom is pretty timid and under his overbearing grandmother's thumb, although he does grow up to be brave. 

Does the hat prognosticate their future personalities and sort the students accordingly? This seems to make sense for Neville, who grows up to be incredibly brave. But probably not, as these examples show: 

1. Regulus Black and Andromeda Tonks are both sorted into Slytherin, even when they grow up to be disillusioned with the Slytherin pureblood supremacy cause. Although, one can be cunning _and_ brave.

2. Yet another example is Cedric Diggory, who is a Hupplepuff, but shows incredible bravery and resilience while completing all but the last level of the Triwizard tournament. This might not be a good example, as one can have both Gryffindor and Hufflepuff qualities. Yet, since the Triwizard Tournament is a big part of Cedric's participation in the books, it probably would have made more sense for him to be in Gryffindor. 

3. Peter Pettigrew grows up to betray his friends, get Lily and James Killed and Sirius imprisoned in Azkaban. He actively lacks the quintessential Gryffindor bravery. His whole character is defined by his cowardice.

The prevalence of familial trends within houses adds another layer of complexity. Personality traits are not hereditary (although family does influence your personality, all 7 siblings in the Weasley family getting into Gryffindor seems improbable), so does the Hat take the students' choices into account? This seems probable, as we see Harry get sorted into Gryffindor after the Hat remarks that he would have fit into any of the houses _especially Slytherin_. (in the Chamber of Secrets, we see Harry grappling with the possibility of himself being the Heir of Slytherin, one of the reasons for his confusion is this particular remark). But if the Hat _only_ took the students' choice into account, there would not be much reason to have a sorting hat at all. Maybe the sorting hat takes your choice into account, only if there is already those characteristics in you. But as I have proven above, the Hat does not particularly seem to care about the ovjective personality traits either (past or present).

As this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/5zdqfh/harry_potter_the_sorting_hat_sorts_students_based/) suggests, maybe the Hat takes into account the qualities which you _value_ the most. This sorts out the people who seemingly got sorted into the wrong house, as they got sorted according to what qualities they believed was superior. Peter Pettigrew could have valued bravery and valour over the other qualities and wanted to possess those qualities, Cedric could have values hardwork and loyalty over bravery, and Tonks and Regulus could have believed in their families' obsession with pureblood politics at the time of sorting. It would also explain the prevalence of wizard families staying within the same house, as family might not influence personality much but it _could influence values_. A child need not necessarily have a trait to go into a particular house, but merely value it. 

However in this passage, 

```
The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.

"Hmm," said a small voice in his ear. "Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting... So where shall I put you?"

Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.

"Not Slytherin, eh?" said the small voice. "Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you're sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!"
```

From the Hat's dialogue with Harry, it does seem to take his his courage, intellect, and ambition into account. This again does not line up with the previous theory. This nuance contradicts the theory that it merely reflects students' values, suggesting a more multifaceted assessment.

The houses seem to be a crucial element in the Harry Potter lore, yet we do not know much about the Sorting Hat. Rivalries, friendships and relationships are formed within house lines, which influence major events in the Harry Potter Universe. 

Who knows, maybe Voldemort would never have become Voldemort and become Professor Riddle, the best Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher in Hogwarts' history, had he not been sorted into Slytherin?

Tom Riddle was sorted into Slytherin due to his cunning and his ambition. His peers in Slytherin who were adherents of Pureblood ideology might have influenced him to become more like them and believe in Pureblood supremacy. Had he been sorted into Gryffindor, Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff, his trajectory might have been altered—though whether for better or worse remains speculative. He was after all, a half-blood himself as he had a muggle father. Then again, he might still have turned out to be just as sadistic, as there is a theory that since Voldemort was conceived under the influence of love-potion, he was incapable of love.  

Similarly, had Dumbledore been sorted into Slytherin, he might have had a completely different life path. He had bad experiences with muggles (his sister Ariana was permanently disabled by muggles and his father was prosecuted for going after the muggle boys who harmed her) and he was also affliated with Grindelwald in his youth. He also believed in a complete revamp of wizard-muggle relations supposedly "for the greater good". 

Who knows, maybe in an alternate universe, Dumbledore is the villain, Tom Riddle is the kindly headmaster, and Hermione Granger struggles with her academics?

In the end, the Sorting Hat's decisions remain a mystery, leaving us to wonder about the intricacies of its judgment and the impact it has had on the wizarding world.
