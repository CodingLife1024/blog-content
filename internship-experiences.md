# Internship Experiences: An Essay to Future Me
## 03/08/2024 

Last month, I finished my summer internship. Coincidentally, I got the location in Mumbai (luckily or unluckily), quite close to where I actually live (when not on campus, at least). 

Here are the major learnings from my experience

### Weather and Travel

My office was (only) 1.25 hours away by train. The major part of my internship was during the peak Mumbai monsoon. Train services sometimes got delayed or worse, cancelled. Initially, I hated it. The near constant rain, the perpetually wet (and usually not empty) train seats, the crowds, and the uncertainty of reaching the office on time were quite frustrating. 

However, as time passed, I began to see the positives to the daily train journeys. I now had atleast 2.5 hours every day all to myself, and I spent this time reading e-books, watching instagram reels and standup comedy. 

### What I Learned During the Workplace

#### Technical Skills

##### How to build production level Python libraries

I had to look up the open source code of several other Python libraries (like Scikit-learn and ast) to find the best practices for developing them. In the process, I learned how to deploy my own libraries to PyPi (although, the library I built within the firm was not deployed publicly). 

##### Practices to follow while writing code that will later be reviewed and modified by other developers (to make their and your own future selves' lives easier)

- Naming conventions of variables and functions: Name variables and functions to be precise and typo-free. The name should make clear the purpose. 

- Documentation processes of code: Write docstrings to functions wherever necessary. 

    ```
    Readability counts.
    - Zen of Python
    ```

##### How to reduce reliance on ChatGPT or similar LLMs in coding

Due to security reasons, the firm did not allow the use of external LLMs. I was quite embarassed to realise just how dependent on LLMs I had become. I relied on official documentation and Stack Overflow to debug and build code.

#### Soft Skills and Communication Skills

##### Effective Communication

Regular team meetings, progress reports, and code reviews taught me how to present my ideas and updates effectively. I also interacted with various stakeholders, which improved my ability to convey technical concepts to non-technical audiences.

##### Team Collaboration

I learned how to contribute to group projects, share responsibilities, and support my colleagues. This experience also highlighted the importance of listening to others' perspectives and incorporating their feedback to improve the overall quality of our work.

(This is unlike college projects, wherein one person ends up doing most of the work.)

##### Presentation Skills

Towards the end of my internship, all interns did a project fair where people from different departments came to listen to us talk about our projects. I prepared the presentation for weeks before, and was successful at the actual event too. 

##### Time Management

Balancing multiple tasks and meeting deadlines was a crucial part of my internship. I developed better time management skills by prioritizing tasks, setting realistic goals, and maintaining a structured schedule.

##### Adaptability

I had to adjust to changing project requirements, learn new tools and technologies on the fly, and quickly adapt to feedback. 

#### Personal Growth

##### Confidence Building

Gaining practical experience and successfully completing projects boosted my confidence. I realized my potential and capability to contribute meaningfully to real-world projects. 

##### Professionalism

Observing and interacting with experienced professionals taught me about workplace etiquette, professionalism, and maintaining a positive attitude even in challenging situations.

### Challenges Faced

#### Initial Difficulties

Adjusting to the work culture and managing the workload were initially challenging. Adapting to the firm's internal software also took a while, as they were sometimes a bit different than the regular versions that I was used to. Understanding the expectations and finding a rhythm took some time, but with guidance from my mentors and colleagues, I gradually adapted.

#### Overcoming Challenges

I developed strategies to overcome these challenges by seeking feedback, asking for help when needed, and continuously improving my skills. The support from my team played a huge role in overcoming these obstacles.

### What I Wish I Knew

#### Ask for Help Whenever Needed

I do not know when I internalised the idea that I had to do everything by myself. 

#### Maintaining a Healthy Work-life Balance

I learned the importance of setting boundaries, taking breaks, and ensuring time for relaxation and hobbies. This balance is essential for overall well-being and productivity.

### Conclusion

Reflecting on my internship, I realize how transformative this experience has been. From adapting to Mumbai's unpredictable weather to mastering new technical and soft skills, every challenge was an opportunity for growth. The daily train journeys taught me patience and the value of personal time, while the workplace environment honed my communication, collaboration, and adaptability skills. Looking ahead, I hope to carry forward these lessons with a renewed sense of confidence and professionalism. This internship didn't just prepare me for the next step in my career, it prepared me for life's many journeys, where every rain-soaked challenge holds the promise of new beginnings and endless possibilities.

Dear future me, I hope you always remember these lessons. Embrace each challenge, stay resilient, and keep growing with every step you take.
