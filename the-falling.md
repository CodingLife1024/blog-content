# The Falling(2014)
## 14/02/2024

A few days ago, I watched a film titled, "The Falling". It was released in 2014 and had Carol Morley as its director. It is an enigmatic portrayal of adolescence and female friendships against the backdrop of a conservative all-girls school in the 1960s.

At the heart of the film is Lydia Lamont (played by Maisie Williams, of The Game of Thrones fame). She and her best friend Abbie Mortimer (played by Florence Pugh, from Midsommar) are both 16 and are partners in crime and love. Lydia is fixated on Abbie and looks up to her, possibly in a subconscious attempt to experience the love of her distant and agoraphobic mother. 

Trouble starts when Abbie gets pregnant by a boy and they try to figure out how to proceed after this revelation. In an attempt to abort the pregnancy, Abbie sleeps with Lydia's older brother Kenneth, who talks about spells and magic and ley lines. This bothers Lydia, who is jealously possessive of Abbie.

After serving detention after school one day, Abbie absent-mindedly remarks that she wants to keep the baby. Lydia argues with her about about her increasingly out-of-character behaviour, as Abbie suffers from a nosebleed snd faints. She dies soon after.

Lydia does not cry at Abbie's funeral. Her behaviour becomes increasingly unstable, culminating in her going into a trance-like state and performing a slow, macabre  dance in art class, followed by her falling unconscious. After this, almost all her classmates suffer from fainting spells without any apparent medical cause. After a mass fainting incident in the school assembly, the principal gets all the girls hospitalised. No medical cause is found, and a psychiatrist diagnoses them with mass hysteria. 

Lydia becomes increasingly rebellious and is eventually expelled from the school. She is consumed by her memories of Abbie and hatred for her mother. After her mother catches her and Kenneth sleeping together, she reveals that Lydia and Kenneth are half-siblings, and implies that Lydia is the result of the rape. She runs out of the house: there is a full moon, and she climbs the large symbolic tree that overshadows the lake. She proclaims that she is at last 'free', 'real' and fully 'conscious' â€“ although it is not clear whether she then jumps into the lake, or simply slips and falls by accident. She is pursued by Eileen (who struggles with flashbacks of the rape). She jumps or falls from a large tree into the lake outside the school. Her mother hugs her body and cries, as Lydia regains consciousness. The two women hold each other and cry. 

The Falling blurs the boundary between dream and reality. It is never made specified whether the girls are pretending or just fainting uncontrollably. There may be a kind of empathic contagion here. Lydia is to some extent copying the circumstances of Abbie's death; and the other girls appear to copy Lydia. Miss Alvaro believes that Lydia is faking: at one point, when she passes out in her office, Miss Alvaro pricks her with a pin to wake her up.  After large numbers of girls are taken to hospital, several recover fairly quickly; but the others begin to compete with each other as to whether they are in the more or less 'advanced stages' of the condition, and they later accuse each other of being 'fake'.
