# The Falling(2014)
## 14/02/2024

A few days ago, I watched a film titled, "The Falling". It was released in 2014 and had Carol Morley as its director. It is an enigmatic portrayal of adolescence and female friendships against the backdrop of a conservative all-girls school in the 1960s.

At the heart of the film is Lydia Lamont (played by Maisie Williams, of The Game of Thrones fame). She and her best friend Abbie Mortimer (played by Florence Pugh, from Midsommar) are both 16 and are partners in crime and love. Lydia is fixated on Abbie and looks up to her, possibly in a subconscious attempt to experience the love of her distant and agoraphobic mother. 

Trouble starts when Abbie gets pregnant by a boy and they try to figure out how to proceed after this revelation. In an attempt to abort the pregnancy, Abbie sleeps with Lydia's older brother Kenneth, who talks about spells and magic and ley lines. This bothers Lydia, who is jealously possessive of Abbie.

After serving detention after school one day, Abbie absent-mindedly remarks that she wants to keep the baby. Lydia argues with her about about her increasingly out-of-character behaviour, as Abbie suffers from a nosebleed snd faints. She dies soon after.

Lydia does not cry at Abbie's funeral.
