# Studio Ghibli films: The Theme of Growing Up
## 15/05/2024

While Studio Ghibli's **The Boy and The Heron** got this 2024's Best Animated Feature at the Oscars, it isn't the best work of either Miyazaki or the animation studio. Within the films, there are layered, complex narratives, often interwined with elements of fantasy, folklore the supernatural. The engaging worldbuilding and adventures of the characters (who are usually children) appeals to other children, and the deeper themes and messages about common human experiences makes them emotionally engaging to adults. The films deal with universal human experiences such as growing up, friendship, parental conflict, illness and death. Some delve into emotionally weighty themes like the stark realities of war and the heartbreaking experience of losing one or both parents. Several delve into a protagonist's search for and/or (re)discovery of oneself. 

<!-- Studio Ghibli films often explore the theme of self-discovery and personal growth. In movies like **Spirited Away** and **Howl's Moving Castle**, we witness young protagonists embarking on transformative journeys that lead them to discover their true selves. These coming-of-age stories resonate with audiences of all ages, as they capture the universal struggle of finding one's place in the world.

Moreover, Studio Ghibli films excel in portraying the complexities of friendship. From the heartwarming bond between Totoro and the two sisters in **My Neighbor Totoro** to the unlikely friendship between Seita and Setsuko in **Grave of the Fireflies**, these films showcase the power of connection and the importance of supporting one another through life's challenges.

Parental conflict is another recurring theme in Studio Ghibli films. Whether it's the strained relationship between Chihiro and her parents in **Spirited Away** or the absent parents in **Kiki's Delivery Service**, these narratives explore the impact of familial dynamics on a child's growth and development. By addressing these sensitive topics, Studio Ghibli films encourage viewers to reflect on their own relationships and the role of family in their lives.

Lastly, death is a theme that is handled with great sensitivity in Studio Ghibli films. Movies like **Princess Mononoke** and **The Wind Rises** delve into the fragility of life and the consequences of human actions. These thought-provoking narratives remind us of the interconnectedness of all living beings and the importance of cherishing our planet.

In conclusion, Studio Ghibli films go beyond mere entertainment. They touch upon profound themes that resonate with audiences on a deep emotional level. Through their captivating storytelling and stunning animation, these films inspire us to reflect on our own experiences and embrace the journey of self-discovery and personal growth. -->

Here, we discuss how popular Ghibli films and protagonists are reflections of ourselves and our collective experiences.

## Spirited Away

Like many others, this was my introduction to Studio Ghibli and its works. Released in 2001, 
its story of a young girl, Chihiro taking on a mission of saving her parents in a magical world proves to be a transformative journey for her and many others she encounters along the way. At the start of the movie, Chihoro is a typical 10 year old - fearful and dependent on her parents. To save her parents who have turned into pigs, she is takes a job at the bathhouse, which works as a metaphor for adult responsibilities. She rediscovers who she is and her identity, when she reclaims her name from Yubaba. Chihiro learns the importance of empathy and kindness. She helps others selflessly, whether it's aiding the polluted river spirit or showing compassion to No-Face. By the end of the film, Chihiro has matured enough to let go of her attachment to the spirit world and move forward with her life. This ability to let go of the past and face the future is a critical aspect of maturing. 

In summary, "Spirited Away" uses the fantastical journey of Chihiro to illustrate the real-world process of growing up.

## My Neighbour Totoro

This film focuses more on family relationships and dealing with uncertainty and illness. The story takes place after Satsuki and Mei move to a new house, which significantly changes their lives. Their mother is in the hospital, adding an element of uncertainty and worry. The film shows how the children cope with such changes and uncertainties.

Satsuki, being the older sister, takes on a caretaker role for Mei, especially in the absence of their mother. This responsibility is a significant part of her growing up, as she learns to balance her own needs with caring for her younger sister. 

The film emphasizes the importance of family support. Despite the absence of their mother, the girls receive emotional support from their friends and neighbors. This shows how strong interpersonal relationships help in personal growth and stability.

Both girls deal differently with the uncertainty of their mother's illness. Their interactions with Totoro and the other forest spirits help them deal with these challenges. They both learn to balance responsibilities and their own worries.

## Only Yesterday

This film is quite different from others. Rather than having a child as a protagonist who becomes wiser through new experiences, it follows a young woman, Taeko as she visits her hometown and revisits her long-forgotten childhood memories and emerges with a deeper understanding of herself and her life.
