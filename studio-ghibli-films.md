# Studio Ghibli films: The Theme of Growing Up
## 15/05/2024

While Studio Ghibli's **The Boy and The Heron** got this 2024's Best Animated Feature at the Oscars, it isn't the best work of either Miyazaki or the animation studio. Within the films, there are layered, complex narratives, often interwined with elements of fantasy, folklore the supernatural. The engaging worldbuilding and adventures of the characters (who are usually children) appeals to other children, and the deeper themes and messages about common human experiences makes them emotionally engaging to adults. The films deal with universal human experiences such as growing up, friendship, parental conflict, and death. Some delve into emotionally weighty themes like the stark realities of war and the heartbreaking experience of losing parents. Several delve into a protagonist's search for and/or (re)discovery of oneself. 

<!-- Studio Ghibli films often explore the theme of self-discovery and personal growth. In movies like **Spirited Away** and **Howl's Moving Castle**, we witness young protagonists embarking on transformative journeys that lead them to discover their true selves. These coming-of-age stories resonate with audiences of all ages, as they capture the universal struggle of finding one's place in the world.

Moreover, Studio Ghibli films excel in portraying the complexities of friendship. From the heartwarming bond between Totoro and the two sisters in **My Neighbor Totoro** to the unlikely friendship between Seita and Setsuko in **Grave of the Fireflies**, these films showcase the power of connection and the importance of supporting one another through life's challenges.

Parental conflict is another recurring theme in Studio Ghibli films. Whether it's the strained relationship between Chihiro and her parents in **Spirited Away** or the absent parents in **Kiki's Delivery Service**, these narratives explore the impact of familial dynamics on a child's growth and development. By addressing these sensitive topics, Studio Ghibli films encourage viewers to reflect on their own relationships and the role of family in their lives.

Lastly, death is a theme that is handled with great sensitivity in Studio Ghibli films. Movies like **Princess Mononoke** and **The Wind Rises** delve into the fragility of life and the consequences of human actions. These thought-provoking narratives remind us of the interconnectedness of all living beings and the importance of cherishing our planet.

In conclusion, Studio Ghibli films go beyond mere entertainment. They touch upon profound themes that resonate with audiences on a deep emotional level. Through their captivating storytelling and stunning animation, these films inspire us to reflect on our own experiences and embrace the journey of self-discovery and personal growth. -->

Here, we discuss how popular Ghibli films and protagonists are reflections of ourselves and our collective experiences.

## Spirited Away

Like many others, this was my introduction to Studio Ghibli and its works. Released in 2001, 
its story of a young girl taking on a mission of saving her parents in a magical world proves to be a transformative journey for her and many others she encounters along the way.
