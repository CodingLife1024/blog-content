# Studio Ghibli films: The Theme of Growing Up
## 16/06/2024

While Studio Ghibli's **The Boy and The Heron** got this 2024's Best Animated Feature at the Oscars, it isn't the best work of either Miyazaki or the animation studio. Within the films, there are layered, complex narratives, often interwined with elements of fantasy, folklore the supernatural. The engaging worldbuilding and adventures of the characters (who are usually children) appeals to other children, and the deeper themes and messages about common human experiences makes them emotionally engaging to adults. The films deal with universal human experiences such as growing up, friendship, parental conflict, illness and death. Some delve into emotionally weighty themes like the stark realities of war and the heartbreaking experience of losing one or both parents. Several delve into a protagonist's search for and/or (re)discovery of oneself. 

Here, we discuss how popular Ghibli films and protagonists are reflections of ourselves and our collective experiences.

## Spirited Away

Like many other Ghibli fans, this was my introduction to Studio Ghibli and its works. Released in 2001, 
its story of a young girl, Chihiro taking on a mission of saving her parents in a magical world proves to be a transformative journey for her and many others she encounters along the way. At the start of the movie, Chihoro is a typical 10 year old - fearful and dependent on her parents. To save her parents who have turned into pigs, she is takes a job at the bathhouse, which works as a metaphor for adult responsibilities. She rediscovers who she is and her identity, when she reclaims her name from Yubaba. Chihiro learns the importance of empathy and kindness. She helps others selflessly, whether it's aiding the polluted river spirit or showing compassion to No-Face. By the end of the film, Chihiro has matured enough to let go of her attachment to the spirit world and move forward with her life. This ability to let go of the past and face the future is a critical aspect of maturing. 

In summary, "Spirited Away" uses the fantastical journey of Chihiro to illustrate the real-world process of growing up.

## My Neighbour Totoro

This film focuses more on family relationships and dealing with uncertainty and illness. The story takes place after Satsuki and Mei move to a new house, which significantly changes their lives. Their mother is in the hospital, adding an element of uncertainty and worry. The film shows how the children cope with such changes and uncertainties.

Satsuki, being the older sister, takes on a caretaker role for Mei, especially in the absence of their mother. This responsibility is a significant part of her growing up, as she learns to balance her own needs with caring for her younger sister. 

The film emphasizes the importance of family support. Despite the absence of their mother, the girls receive emotional support from their friends and neighbors. This shows how strong interpersonal relationships help in personal growth and stability.

Both girls deal differently with the uncertainty of their mother's illness. Their interactions with Totoro and the other forest spirits help them deal with these challenges. They both learn to balance responsibilities and their own worries.

## Only Yesterday

This film is quite different from other Studio Ghibli films. Rather than having a child as a protagonist who becomes wiser through new experiences, it follows a young woman, Taeko as she visits her hometown and revisits her long-forgotten childhood memories and emerges with a deeper understanding of herself and her life. Unlike many Ghibli movies that feature fantastical elements, "Only Yesterday" delves into the ordinary and profound moments of a person's life.

Taeko's journey is internal and personal. Through her nostalgic trip to the countryside and reflection on her past, the film portrays a universal experience of coming to terms with one's own identity and aspirations. 

## Kiki's Delivery Service

At its core, the film portrays Kiki's quest for independence. She moves to a new town alone on her 13th birthday, establishes her own delivery service, and learns to navigate the challenges of running a business and managing relationships, all while grappling with self-doubt and homesickness. She has a black cat, Jiji who is extremely loyal to her and can talk.

Things run smoothly until she gets caught up in the rain on one of her jobs, resulting in her getting sick. Although she recovers soon, she grows depressed and loses interest in her job, causing her to lose her magical abilities, including talking to Jiji.

Towards the end of the film, Jiji starts to live a more normal life, starting a family with another cat and not being around Kiki and her friends as often. When the two meet up again at the end of Kiki's Delivery Service, Jiji is shown getting along quite nicely with his new love interest and her kittens. Although he and Kiki are still implied to be friends according to the letter she writes to her parents, he is seemingly no longer her familiar.

There is the possibility that Jiji was always a normal cat and Kiki only imagined him talking to her, like a child creating imaginary friends and conversations. At the end of the movie, Kiki is not so childish anymore and has her own friends and therefore does not need Jiji to talk to her.

Through their friendship, Anna experiences a sense of belonging and acceptance. Marnie becomes not only a friend and confidante who listens to Anna's innermost thoughts and fears without judgment. 

Anna discovers that Marnie is actually her biological grandmother, who has passed away. Furthermore, the film's portrayal of the passage of time and the blending of past and present highlights the theme of nostalgia and memory.
