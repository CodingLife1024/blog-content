# Pride: A History
## 14/01/2024

Yesterday and today marked the 2nd edition of Vibhinn, an LGBTQIA+ pride fest conducted on the IIT Delhi campus. Themed "Information and Injustice," the event featured many prominent gay and trans rights activists as speakers. One such individual was Shabnam Mausi, the only transperson to get elected as an MLA in India and Sr. Adv. Saurabh Kirpal, a senior advocate at the Delhi High Court, who has taken up cases to further sexual, gender rights, and written on subject.

As a 6th-semester student, I must admit that this is the first time I have ever participated in any activity conducted by Indradhanu, the Queer Collective at IIT Delhi. Although I have believed in the importance of LGBTQIA+ rights for a few years now, I never joined Indradhanu or participated due to personal misgivings, fear of reputation loss, prejudice towards the transgender community, and annoyance at the "pronoun brigade."

I finally decided to get involved with Indradhanu this semester after a severe bout of FOMO (I am in my semi-final year at IIT Delhi, this is my 3rd to last semester, time does fly by so fast these days) prompted me to bridge the gap and engage with Indradhanu. The experience has been illuminating, to say the least. I have made good friends and discovered a whole new dimension of platonic male-female friendships. This personal journey leads me to reflect on the broader history of the LGBTQIA+ rights movement, notably the Stonewall Riots and the origins of Pride Month.

## A Timeline of the 1969 Uprising:

Looking back at the history of Pride, one cannot ignore the pivotal moment at the Stonewall Inn in 1969. This ignited the flame for queer activism and laid the foundation for Pride Month, celebrated annually in June.

**June 24, 1969:** Police arrest Stonewall employees.

On a summer night in 1969, the police raided the Stonewall Inn, a bar located in Greenwich Village of New York, which served as a safe haven for the city's gay, lesbian, and transgender communities. At that time, bars and restaurants could get shut down for serving gay customers or having gay staff. Police raids on gay bars were common, but on that particular night, members of the city's LGBTQ+ community fought back, sparking off an uprising that led to a new era of resistance.

**June 27 - 28, 1969:** Stonewall crowd erupts after police arrest and rough up patrons.

After midnight on Friday, several plainclothes police officers entered the bar when it was packed. They singled out employees as well as drag queens and other cross dressing people for arrest. At that time "masquerading as the opposite sex" (a.k.a, crossdressing) was regarded as a crime in NYC. 

Meanwhile, a crowd formed outside the bar. A police van arrived, and loaded Stonewall employees and cross dressers inside. 

**Early hours of June 28, 1969:** Transgender women resist arrest.

Accounts vary, but according to witness reports, the crown erupted after the police roughed up a woman dressed in masculine attire. People started taunting the police, throwing pennies and bottles at them. Tyres of the police vans were slashed. 

Two transgender women of color, Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, were said to have resisted arrest and thrown the first bottle (or brick or stone) at the cops, respectively. Although Johnson later said in a 1987 podcast interview with historian Eric Marcus that she had not arrived until the uprising was well underway. 

The exact breakdown of who did what first remains unclear. This was way before the smartphone revolution. 

**Close to 4 a.m. June 28, 1969:** Police retreat and barricade themselves inside Stonewall.

The growing mob forced the police officers of the original raiding party to retreat into Stonewall and barricade themselves inside. 

Some rioters used a parking meter as a battering ram to break through the door; others threw beer bottles, trash and other objects. 

More police officers arrived, alongwith squadrons of the Tactical Patrol Force (TPF), the cityâ€™s riot police. As the helmeted officers marched in formation down Christopher Street, protesters outsmarted them by running away, then circling back up behind the officers.

Finally, sometime after 4 a.m., things settled down. Amazingly, no one died or was critically injured on the first night of rioting, though a few police officers reported injuries.

**June 28 - 29: Stonewall reopens, supporters gather:** Police beat and tear gas the crowd.

Stonewall opened up the next night, and more supporters showed up, chanting logans like "gay power" and "we shall overcome". 

Again the police were called to restore order, who beat and tear-gassed the crowd. This continued until the early hours of the next morning. 

**June 29 - July 1, 1969:** Stonewall becomes gathering point for LGBTQ activists.

Over the next several nights, gay activists continued to gather near the Stonewall, taking advantage of the moment to spread information and build the community that would fuel the growth of the gay rights movement. Though police officers also returned, the mood was less confrontational, with isolated skirmishes replacing the large-scale riots of the weekend.

**July 2, 1969:** Gay activists protest newspaper coverage.

In response to the Village Voice's coverage of the riots, which referred to "the forces of faggotry," protesters swarmed outside the paper's offices. The New York Daily News also resorted to homophobic slurs in its detailed coverage, running the headline: "Homo Nest Raided, Queen Bees Are Stinging Mad."

**June 28, 1970:** First Gay Pride parade sets off from Stonewall.

On the first anniversary of the police raid on the Stonewall Inn, gay activists in New York organized the Christopher Street Liberation March to cap off the city's first Gay Pride Week. As several hundred people began marching up 6th Avenue toward Central Park, supporters from the crowd joined them. The procession eventually stretched some 15 city blocks, encompassing thousands of people.

Activists from other cities organised gay pride celebrations in the same year. 

**Lasting Impact of Stonewall**

The frenzy of activism born on that first night at Stonewall would eventually fuel gay rights movements in Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Australia and New Zealand, among other countries, becoming a lasting force that would carry on for the next half-century - and beyond.

We celebrate June as Pride Month in honour and rememberance of the Stonewall riots and the goals of gay rights movements across the world. We march for equality for all, regardless of gender, sex or sexuality and call to the right to love, work and live as we choose.
