# AI Art: My experiences and Controversies
## 28/03/2024

About a year ago, I almost completely gave up sketching. It seemed to take too much time and a lot of my time was spent in thinking of things to sketch while not actively sketching. Then came the added guilt of not finishing a sketch fast enough or doing it too long. Art is something to be enjoyed, not something to be done like a duty. The last time I actively sketched was in October 2022 (Inktober). I do not remember the last time I sketched. 

I discovered AI art about that time. Initially I used Nightcafe, then started using Leonardo AI as well.
