# AI Art: Experiences and Controversies
## 04/04/2024

About a year ago, I almost completely gave up sketching. It seemed to take too much time and a lot of my time was spent in thinking of things to sketch while not actively sketching. Then came the added guilt of not finishing a sketch fast enough or doing it too long. Art is something to be enjoyed, not something to be done like a duty. The last time I actively sketched was in October 2022 (for Inktober'22). I do not remember the last time I sketched. 

I discovered AI art about that time. Initially I used Nightcafe, then started using Leonardo AI as well. Some platforms use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a type of AI architecture capable of producing realistic images by pitting two neural networks against each other. Others employed style transfer techniques, enabling the transformation of ordinary images into works of art inspired by renowned artists or artistic styles.

Then I got to know about the controversies surrounding AI generated art. AI art carries a lot of implications about creativity and artists. 

### Creativity in the age of advanced AI tools

When advanced text-to-image tools can edit existing photographs seamlessly, generate images using particular styles, and even produce pieces in the style of any artist who has ever lived, it raises the question of whether human creativity may once become obsolete. Artists spend years developing particular art styles, only to have it being appropriated by AI algorithms. 

AI generated art allows individuals to generate and post more artwork than they've have the skills for, leading to both excitement and controversy. Advocates of AI-generated art argue that it opens up new possibilities and expands the definition of what art can be. However, critics are skeptical and some believe AI produces poor-quality art.

### Should we consider AI-generated images art?

Debates about what should be considered art have always existed. Many artists were uneasy at the development of the camera, which they perceived as a replacement for human talent. Purists in the 20th century also condemned digital editing tools and computer-assisted design programs for relying too heavily on the work of untrained human collaborators. 

In 2018, the painting entitled Portrait of Edmond Belamy became the first-ever piece created by artificial intelligence to be sold at a major auction.

However, experts and art critics say that AI art lacks real creativity as they are trained using already existing images of different artists and cannot truly come up with its own original styles.

### Legal considerations for AI art

Legal frameworks are still evolving with AI, and its legalities can vary with area and circumstances. 

#### Who owns AI art?

Concerns have been raised about the ownership and copyright of AI generated artwork. Is it the artist who engineered the prompt, the AI algorithm itself or the developers of the AI? This question becomes even more complicated when the AI is trained on copyrighted works. 

One notable example of this is Getty Images' suit against Stability AI, which was accused of having "unlawfully copied and processed millions of images protected by copyright and the associated metadata owned or represented by Getty Images".

#### Can AI art be copyrighted?

The specific copyright laws vary from area to area. In India, the current Copyright Act of 1957 doesn't acknowledge AI as an author or address AI-generated works. The law requires that a work be original and creative to qualify for copyright protection, but generative AI can produce responses without relying on original works. This makes it difficult to award copyright to an AI-generated work under the Indian Traditional Originality Framework. 

### Unethical data collection

One of the biggest problems digital artists cite with AI art generators is the issue of how they got the data they use to create new works.

#### Consent, and lack thereof

One of the biggest problems digital artists cite with AI art generators is the issue of how they got the data they use to create new works. The training data in the form of images are often procured throught web-scraping of art on the internet on sites like DeviantArt and Pinterest. 

And since AI tools can’t generate art out of nothing, that training wasn’t passive either. It’s not the same as a human learning from Da Vinci by studying his work and trying to paint like him.

#### A question of respect

A big reason for plenty of artists' anger is the apparent lack of respect for their work.

Imagine learning that an app you worked hard on was bought from your original client, and it had its name changed. The new owner then decides they 'created' the app all alone, merely because they changed a few lines of the code (while still using large chunks of what you and your team wrote).

### Devaluation of human work

It might be tempting to say that modern technology (like AI) just helps people get things done more efficiently. If anything, the way AI art has suddenly exploded onto the scene is more comparable to the introduction of computers that could handle complex calculations. Back in the day, this came as a shock to human calculators at institutions like NASA, who were left wondering whether their work would still have a place in the future. AI art generators can't fully replace human artists right now, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t still devaluing human art all the same.

#### Negative impact on income

While not everyone who calls themselves an artist makes a living off of their work or aims to sell art online, plenty do. Business growth is difficult to achieve when losing clients and leads to cheap or free AI art generators.

#### Creation vs prompting

For better or worse, AI ‘artists’ create their pieces by entering prompts into a machine. They may or may not choose to edit the results they get from that machine, but that’s the extent of the work they contribute to its initial creation.

Digital and traditional artists, meanwhile, usually start with a blank canvas. They have to learn how to create art, put in hours and hours of practice, and then finally use all their accumulated knowledge to turn a thought into something others will appreciate looking at.

And those two kinds of creation processes are not alike. To suggest they raise quite serious ethical concerns and is a big factor in angering some artists.

#### Time and effort

No artist is born knowing how to create masterpieces. Everyone who’s interested in creating art has to spend time practicing, learning, studying, and generally working on their skills to reach a point where they can consistently create pieces they’re proud of.

AI-produced art casts a grim light on all of this time and effort.

When art is available with a quick prompt instead of hours of hard work, the value of that hard work goes down. That’s bad news for artists, because it makes it much harder for them to both charge living wages for their work, and to see value in the effort they put in.

#### Unique styles and their value

Before AI art, an artist could spend years developing a unique and difficult-to-imitate style. People who loved that style would then be able to commission that artist for a one-of-a-kind piece, so they could enjoy the specific art style for themselves.

However, AI art generators can now be taught to copy almost any kind of style. This disincentivizes original approaches – why put in all that work just for someone to come along and feed all your pieces to a generator without paying you a penny?

This might be less infuriating to artists if they were compensated every time their work was used in this way, but this is almost never the case.

### Conclusion

Decades ago, futurists dreamed of a time when computers would take over all the drudge work so that humans could be free to spend their lives doing what they most enjoyed. For many people, this vision included an idea of creativity: writing poetry, composing music... and making art.

So it’s not surprising that many artists are a little disillusioned that the modern reality of AI seems to be making the opposite happen. While we’ve only really scraped the surface so far in terms of what AI is capable of, AI-produced art is likely to remain controversial for the foreseeable future.
