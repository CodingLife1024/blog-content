# AI Art: My experiences and Controversies
## 28/03/2024

About a year ago, I almost completely gave up sketching. It seemed to take too much time and a lot of my time was spent in thinking of things to sketch while not actively sketching. Then came the added guilt of not finishing a sketch fast enough or doing it too long. Art is something to be enjoyed, not something to be done like a duty. The last time I actively sketched was in October 2022 (for Inktober'22). I do not remember the last time I sketched. 

I discovered AI art about that time. Initially I used Nightcafe, then started using Leonardo AI as well. Some platforms use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a type of AI architecture capable of producing realistic images by pitting two neural networks against each other. Others employed style transfer techniques, enabling the transformation of ordinary images into works of art inspired by renowned artists or artistic styles.

Then I got to know about the controversies surrounding AI generated art. AI art carries a lot of implications about creativity and artists. 

### Creativity in the age of advanced AI tools

When advanced text-to-image tools can edit existing photographs seamlessly, generate images using particular styles, and even produce pieces in the style of any artist who has ever lived, it raises the question of whether human creativity may once become obsolete. Artists spend years developing particular art styles, only to have it being appropriated by AI algorithms. 

AI generated art allows individuals to generate and post more artwork than they've have the skills for, leading to both excitement and controversy. Advocates of AI-generated art argue that it opens up new possibilities and expands the definition of what art can be. However, critics are skeptical and some believe AI produces poor-quality art.

### Should we consider AI-generated images art?

Debates about what should be considered art have always existed. Many artists were uneasy at the development of the camera, which they perceived as a replacement for human talent. Purists in the 20th century also condemned digital editing tools and computer-assisted design programs for relying too heavily on the work of untrained human collaborators. 

In 2018, the painting entitled Portrait of Edmond Belamy became the first-ever piece created by artificial intelligence to be sold at a major auction.
