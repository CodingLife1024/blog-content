# AI Art: My experiences and Controversies
## 28/03/2024

About a year ago, I almost completely gave up sketching. It seemed to take too much time and a lot of my time was spent in thinking of things to sketch while not actively sketching. Then came the added guilt of not finishing a sketch fast enough or doing it too long. Art is something to be enjoyed, not something to be done like a duty. The last time I actively sketched was in October 2022 (for Inktober'22). I do not remember the last time I sketched. 

I discovered AI art about that time. Initially I used Nightcafe, then started using Leonardo AI as well. Some platforms use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a type of AI architecture capable of producing realistic images by pitting two neural networks against each other. Others employed style transfer techniques, enabling the transformation of ordinary images into works of art inspired by renowned artists or artistic styles.

Then I got to know about the controversies surrounding AI generated art. AI art carries a lot of implications about creativity and artists. 

### Creativity in the age of advanced AI tools

When advanced text-to-image tools can edit existing photographs seamlessly, generate images using particular styles, and even produce pieces in the style of any artist who has ever lived, it raises the question of whether human creativity may once become obsolete. Artists spend years developing particular art styles, only to have it being appropriated by AI algorithms. 

AI generated art allows individuals to generate and post more artwork than they've have the skills for, leading to both excitement and controversy. Advocates of AI-generated art argue that it opens up new possibilities and expands the definition of what art can be. However, critics are skeptical and some believe AI produces poor-quality art.

### Should we consider AI-generated images art?

Debates about what should be considered art have always existed. Many artists were uneasy at the development of the camera, which they perceived as a replacement for human talent. Purists in the 20th century also condemned digital editing tools and computer-assisted design programs for relying too heavily on the work of untrained human collaborators. 

In 2018, the painting entitled Portrait of Edmond Belamy became the first-ever piece created by artificial intelligence to be sold at a major auction.

However, experts and art critics say that AI art lacks real creativity as they are trained using already existing images of different artists and cannot truly come up with its own original styles.

### Legal considerations for AI art

Legal frameworks are still evolving with AI, and its legalities can vary with area and circumstances. 

#### Who owns AI art?

Concerns have been raised about the ownership and copyright of AI generated artwork. Is it the artist who engineered the prompt, the AI algorithm itself or the developers of the AI? This question becomes even more complicated when the AI is trained on copyrighted works. 

One notable example of this is Getty Images' suit against Stability AI, which was accused of having "unlawfully copied and processed millions of images protected by copyright and the associated metadata owned or represented by Getty Images".

#### Can AI art be copyrighted?

The specific copyright laws vary from area to area. In India, the current Copyright Act of 1957 doesn't acknowledge AI as an author or address AI-generated works. The law requires that a work be original and creative to qualify for copyright protection, but generative AI can produce responses without relying on original works. This makes it difficult to award copyright to an AI-generated work under the Indian Traditional Originality Framework. 

### Unethical data collection

One of the biggest problems digital artists cite with AI art generators is the issue of how they got the data they use to create new works.

#### Consent, and lack thereof

#### A question of respect

### Devaluation of human work

#### Negative impact on income

#### Creation vs prompting

#### Time and effort

#### Unique styles and their value
