# Pride: A history
## 16/01/2024

Yesterday and today were the 2nd edition of Vibhinn, a LGBTQIA+ pride fest conducted on the IIT Delhi campus. It was themed “Information and Injustice” and featured many prominent gay and trans rights activists as speakers. One such individual was Shabnam Mausi, the only transperson to get elected as an MLA in India. 

I am almost ashamed to admit that as a 6th semester student, that this is the first time I have ever participated in any activity conducted by Indradhanu, the Queer Collective at IIT Delhi. Although I have believed in the importance of LGBTQIA+ rights for a few years now, I never joined Indradhanu or participated in it due to personal misgivings, fear of reputation loss, prejudice towards the transgender community and annoyance at the “pronoun brigade”. 

I finally decided to get involved with Indradhanu this semester after a severe bout of FOMO (I am in my semi-final year at IIT Delhi, this is my 3rd to last semester, time does fly by so fast these days) which prompted me to bridge the gap and engage with Indradhanu. The experience has been illuminating, to say the least. I have made good friends and discovered a whole new dimension of platonic male-female friendships. 
This personal journey leads me to reflect on the broader history of the LGBTQIA+ rights movement, notably the Stonewall Riots and the origins of Pride Month. 
Looking back at the history of Pride, one cannot ignore the pivotal moment at the Stonewall Inn in 1969. This ignited the flame for queer activism and laid the foundation for Pride Month, which is celebrated annually in June. 

### A timeline of the 1969 uprising:

On a summer night of 1969, the police raided the Stonewall Inn, a bar located in Greenwich Village of New York. This bar served as a safe haven for the city’s gay, lesbian and transgender communities. At that time, bars and restaurants could get shut down for serving gay customers or having gay staff. 
Polica raids on gay bars were common, but on that particular night, members of the city’s LGBTQ+ community fought back, sparking off an uprising that led to a new era of resistance.
