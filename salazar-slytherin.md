# Harry Potter: On Salazar Slytherin
## 01/03/2024

In the Harry Potter wizarding history, Salazar Slytherin is widely regarded as evil and his name and house are associated with ambition, cunning, and, above all, malevolence. 

Salazar Slytherin was born in 934 - 935 A.D. (according to Pottermore). In the Chamber of Secrets, Professor Binns says:

> "You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago – the precise date is uncertain – by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age."
>
> (Professor Binns, Chamber of Secrets)


This matches up with the data. 

When you consider that, aside from hearsay and legend, we literally know nothing about who Salazar Slytherin was, historical context becomes even more important. Also according to the book lore, Gryffindor and Slytherin used to be best friends before Slytherin went his own way. So, if Slytherin were a dark wizard, why would the other founders have let him into their circle? Even if he were an actor, the other founders would have seen through it with how talented they were said to be.

>When old Slytherin departed.

>And though the fighting then died out.

>He left us quite downhearted."

So it seems the other founders were sad at his leaving, which leaves reason to suspect that their friendship would still be intact.

In this blog post, I will argue that Slytherin might have been justified wanting Hogwarts (and the wizarding world in general) to exclude the Muggleborn and Half-born.

Considering the historical setting at the time Hogwarts, England/Great Britain in 900s - 1000s A.D. was constantly being invaded and there were wars for control over Scotland, England, Wales, and even Ireland.

Examples of warring forces during the time period:

- The Anglo-Saxons (or just Saxons) from Germany
- The Vikings from Scandinavia
- The Welsh from Wales
- The French / Normans from France

Also, we have Merlin and Morgana le Fay who were alive and active during this time period. Rowling also stated that Morgana le Fay, who was supposedly the sister or half-sister of King Arthur of Wales, was "a Dark and powerful sorcreress and a master of Transfiguration, who was an Animagus who took the form of a bird".

Morgana as per the Arthurian lore, built or led an army of her own, probably also including magical folks loyal to her cause.

Also, consider the fact that Hogwarts is a literal war fortress along with being a school, with magical enchantments and defenses to prevent invasion from not just muggles but likely also from _wizarding enemies_. These defenses were later used in the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998 (almost a 1000 years after they were set up). The Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets is clearly meant for magical people, as using it for muggles is probably an overkill. 

So clearly, these precautions were not just to prevent an invasion of muggle armies, but also to prevent takeover by another witch or wizard with less-than-benevolent intentions. 

Hogwarts was canonically founded somewhere around 990 A.D. when Christians were finally taking hold of Scandinavia. Thus, towards the end of the Dark Ages, or else the Early Medieval Period, in which Europe was famous for its intolerance of non-Christendom. The latter of which magic would fall into firmly.

Considering his house's traits, Slytherin would have believed that cunning and ambition would be good tactics should the muggles and the wizarding world go to war. Those with ambition sought ways to rise above all others, and self-preservation meant they would go far for survival. Gryffindor wanted the bravest admitted. He would have thought that the most dauntless of students would provide an army. Ravenclaw valued the tactical advantage of intelligence Should magic be the weapon of protection, a well thought out defence strategy would be needed. Hufflepuff would have had a different view. Admit those loyal to Hogwarts who showed themselves as hard-working, and security would not be an issue. They would also become essential non-military magical citizens. Her students would protect the secret of Hogwarts out of loyalty. 

Four different views, one common goal: survival.

However, add in the factor of Muggleborn witches and wizards, and more complications arise. In days where magic and wizardry were thought to come from the devil, the notion of having a wizard or witch in the family would not be welcomed. Even if magic was accepted by parents out of love, what about their neighbors ?Would a young wizard, born from Muggle parents who hate magic (and likely themselves as well), so readily acclimate to the wizarding world and its norms? They could tell the secrets of the wizarding world, wither out of malice or loyalty to their muggle family. Would it be possible that they all could be put at risk by accepting Muggleborns and Half-borns? This is where Slytherin began to diverge from the other founders and his reputation for prejudice would arise. He may have seen these all as possibilities, and his value on self-preservation would lead him to opinions and actions the others would not agree with.

>"He disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy." 
>
>(Professor Binns, Chamber of Secrets)

Untrustworthy, not lesser or undesirable. This reinforces the point that it was more likely for his exclusion to result from fear than blind hate. Even with protections around Hogwarts, if someone who knew the way led others, all the hard work put into keeping their secret would be lost. Spies and double agents with muggle parentage would have posed a threat to Hogwarts and the safety of Wizards in general. From his perspective, they were more likely to have divided loyalties than pureblood magical folks. Rowling directly says that Muggles and wizards were working together against the interests of Hogwarts.

Gryffindor is well known for bravery, so it would be unlikely that he feared the damage of a handful of Muggle villagers to a school full of wizards. Ravenclaw was wise and would argue that knowledge was the way to peace. According to her, teaching Muggleborns would go a long way to show that there was nothing inherently evil about their gifts. Hufflepuff would want to "take the lot." There is no student she would turn away, regardless of parentage. 

Then we have the Chamber of Secrets, which is often cited as evidence of evil intentions. No normal person would lock a Basilisk in a school full of children. However, what if Slytherin had planned it as a safe room or a last option in case of an all-out war? It would be one that only he could open should the school eventually come under attack. This makes sense considering that Dumbledore put a Cerberus in the school to guard the Philosopher's stone. It would protect the entire school and every student inside. He found a creature that only he could control, a monster that could destroy an entire army just by looking at it, and that could also get around parts of the castle from inside the walls. Over that one thousand years, the Chamber became a legend, and its original purpose could had been forgotten. It is a reasonably safe assumption that when Slytherin stated that his 'own true heir' would return, he probably was not thinking very far into the future. If nothing ever happened, then the Basilisk would remain in the Chamber of Secrets and probably die of starvation or old age at some point, and it would not matter much. 

Fast forward one thousand years, and most wizards and witches know only that his house has produced several dark wizards and has a history of prejudice. With the name of Slytherin House associated with so many dark wizards, it makes sense that its namesake would be too. Then, enter Tom Riddle. A Parselmouth who was actually evil. When the Basilisk attacked students, it was doing so at Tom's command. If Riddle had told the Basilisk to kill only Muggles or giants, the Basilisk would have obeyed. 

Future pureblooded elitists twist Slytherin's words, as a young Voldemort had, having heard only the story that has been passed down for a thousand years and ignore the historical context. 

They were no longer worried about safety. The Death Eaters and their ilk only wanted to keep the magical folks "pure". They were no longer defending themselves against a threat as a people who were faced with prejudice themselves, but instead had become a threat to anyone they did not see as equal. There is no evidence Slytherin ever harmed anyone, unlike the Pureblood supremacists that came later. Slytherin himself was part of a persecuted class in his time and would have directly or indirectly harmed at the hands of prejudice and muggles.

Slytherin could not have predicted the likes of Tom Riddle. The Chamber of Secrets would never have been found otherwise (At least in the Harry Potter books' timeline) and would have lived on only as a legend. 

So goes my theory on Salazar Slytherin. I would love to hear why anyone agrees or disagrees.
