# Harry Potter: On Salazar Slytherin
## 01/03/2024

In the Harry Potter wizarding history, Salazar Slytherin is widely regarded as evil and his name and house are associated with ambition, cunning, and, above all, malevolence. 

Salazar Slytherin was born in 934 - 935 A.D. (according to Pottermore). In the Chamber of Secrets, Professor Binns says:

```
"You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago – the precise date is uncertain – by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age."

(Professor Binns, Chamber of Secrets)
```

This matches up with the data. 

When you consider that, aside from hearsay and "legend", we literally know nothing about who Salazar Slytherin was, historical context becomes even more important. Many fans take pure "hearsay" as fact about Slytherin, without even bothering to give a second thought about how flawed (and likely biased) that information is. Also according to the book lore, Gryffindor and Slytherin used to be best friends before Slytherin went his own way. So, if Slytherin were a dark wizard, why would the other founders have let him into their circle? Even if he were a brilliant actor, one of the other three would have seen through it with how competent they were said to be.

```
"And at last there came a morning.

When old Slytherin departed.

And though the fighting then died out.

He left us quite downhearted."

(Sorting hat, Order of the Phoenix, pg. 206)
```

So it seems the other founders were sad at his leaving, which leaves reason to suspect that their friendship would still be intact.

In this blog post, I will argue that Slytherin maight have been justified wanting Hogwarts (and the wizarding world in general) to exclude muggles and half-borns. 

Considering the historical setting at the time Hogwarts, England/Great Britain in 900s - 1000s A.D. was constantly being invaded and there were numerous wars for control over Scotland, England, Wales, and even Ireland.

Examples of warring forces during the time period:

- The Anglo-Saxons (or just Saxons) from Germany
- The Vikings from Scandinavia
- The Welsh from Wales
- The French / Normans from France

Also, we have Merlin and Morgana le Fay, who, as per Rowling, were alive and active during this time period when Hogwarts was built. Rowling also stated that Morgana le Fay, who was supposedly the sister or half-sister of King Arthur of Wales, was "a Dark and powerful sorcreress and a master of Transfiguration, who was an Animagus who took the form of a bird".

Morgana, too, as per the Arthurian lore that Rowling took inspiration from, built or led an army of her own, probably also including magical folks loyal to her cause.

Also, consider the fact that Hogwarts is a literal war fortress, with magical enchantments and defenses to prevent invasion from not just muggles but likely also from _wizarding enemies_. These defenses were later used in the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998 (almost a 1000 years after they were set up). The Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets is clearly meant for magical people, as using it for muggles is probably an overkill. 

So clearly, these precautions were not just to prevent an invasion of muggle armies, but also to prevent takeover by another witch or wizard with less-than-benevolent intentions. 

Hogwarts was canonically founded somewhere around 990 A.D. when Christians were finally taking hold of Scandinavia. Thus, towards the end of the Dark Ages, or else the Early Medieval Period, in which Europe was famous for its intolerance of non-Christendom. The latter of which magic would fall into firmly.

Considering his house's traits, Salazar Slytherin would have reasonably believed that cunning and resourcefulness would be key tactics should this tension between the muggles and the wizarding world come to blows. Those with ambition sought ways to rise above opposing forces, and self-preservation meant they would go far to achieve the ends necessary for survival. Godric Gryffindor wanted the bravest admitted. He would have thought that the most dauntless of students would provide a ready security, should Hogwarts defenses be compromised. Rowena Ravenclaw valued the tactical advantage intelligence would bring. Should magic be the weapon of protection, a well thought out practical plan would be essential. Helga Hufflepuff would have had a different view. Admit those loyal to Hogwarts who showed themselves as hard-working, and security would not be a problem. Her students would protect the secret of Hogwarts for the sake of loyalty, rather than fear. 

Four different views, one goal: survival.

However, add in the factor of Muggleborn witches and wizards, and an extra layer of problems and complications arise. In days where magic and wizardry were thought to come from the devil, the notion of having a wizard or witch in the family would not be welcomed. Even if magic was accepted by parents out of love, what about their neighbors ?Would a young wizard, born from Muggle parents who loathe magic, so readily acclimate to the wizarding world and its norms? Would it be possible that one of these children could be forced into revealing the secrets of the Wizarding World? Would it be possible that they all could be put at risk by accepting Muggleborn students? That is where Slytherin began to diverge and where his reputation for prejudice could be historically tied. He may have seen these all as possibilities, and his value on self-preservation would lead him to action the others would not agree with.

```
"He disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy." 

(Professor Binns, Chamber of Secrets)
```

Untrustworthy, not lesser or undesirable. This reinforces the point that it was more likely for his exclusion to result from fear than blind hate. Even with protections around Hogwarts, if someone who knew the way led others, all the hard work put into keeping their secret would be lost. Spies and double agents with muggle parentage would have posed a threat to Hogwarts and the safety of Wizards in general. From his perspective, they were more likely to have divided loyalties than pureblood magical folks. Rowling directly says that Muggles and wizards were working together against the interests of Hogwarts.

Gryffindor is well known for bravery, so it would be unlikely that he feared the damage of a handful of Muggle villagers to a school full of wizards. Ravenclaw was wise and would argue that more knowledge, not less, was the way to peace. Teaching Muggleborns would be an excellent way to show that there was nothing inherently evil about their gifts. Hufflepuff would want to "take the lot." There is no student she would turn away, regardless of parentage. 

Then we have the Chamber of Secrets, which is often cited as evidence of malicious intent. No sane man would lock a Basilisk in a school full of children. However, what if Salazar Slytherin had planned it as a safe room? It would be one that only he could open should the school eventually come under attack. This makes sense and would be no different from Dumbledore putting a Cerberus in the school to guard the Philosopher's stone. In fact, it would be more justified in this case. It would not protect one item, but the entire school and every student inside. He found a creature that only he could control, a monster that could annihilate an entire army just by looking at them, and that could also get around parts of the castle from inside the walls. Over that one-thousand years, the Chamber became a legend, and its original purpose could had been forgotten. It is a reasonably safe assumption that when Salazar Slytherin stated that his 'own true heir' would return, he probably was not thinking much further into the future than his great-grandson. If nothing ever happened, then the Basilisk would not get out, and it would not matter. 

Skip ahead one thousand years, and even less is known about Slytherin. Most wizards and witches know only that his house has produced several dark wizards and has a history of prejudice. With the name of Slytherin House tainted by so many dark wizards, it stands to reason that the founder would be as well. Then, enter Tom Riddle. A Parselmouth with delusions of grandeur. When the Basilisk attacked students, it was doing so at Tom's behest. The Basilisk was controlled, and when the voice commanding it told it to kill Muggleborns, it obeyed. If Riddle had told the Basilisk to kill only Muggles or giants or people named Steve, the Basilisk would have done that as well.

Future racists and pureblooded elitists will take and twist Salazar's words, as young Tom had, having heard only the story that has been passed down for a thousand years. They would use this same "caution" to justify their want for genocide.

Except they were no longer worried about safety. Those such as the Death Eaters only wanted to keep themselves "pure." No longer were they defending themselves against a threat as a people who were faced with prejudice themselves, but instead had become a threat to anyone they did not see as equal. Salazar was not wholly right in what he did, but unlike the Pure Blood supremacists that came later, there was no evidence he ever harmed a single person. In fact, Salazar himself was part of a persecuted class and likely would have known those who had been harmed at the hands of prejudice, if not directly impacted by it himself.

Salazar would have had no way of knowing how deeply ingrained the bigotry towards muggleborns would become and certainly had no way of predicting the likes of Tom Riddle. The Chamber of Secrets might never have been found otherwise and would have persisted only as legend.

So goes my theory on Salazar Slytherin. I would love to hear why anyone may agree or disagree.
