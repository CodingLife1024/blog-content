# Pride: A History
## 14/01/2024

Yesterday and today marked the 2nd edition of Vibhinn, an LGBTQIA+ pride fest conducted on the IIT Delhi campus. Themed "Information and Injustice," the event featured many prominent gay and trans rights activists as speakers. One such individual was Shabnam Mausi, the only transperson to get elected as an MLA in India.

As a 6th-semester student, I must admit that this is the first time I have ever participated in any activity conducted by Indradhanu, the Queer Collective at IIT Delhi. Although I have believed in the importance of LGBTQIA+ rights for a few years now, I never joined Indradhanu or participated due to personal misgivings, fear of reputation loss, prejudice towards the transgender community, and annoyance at the "pronoun brigade."

I finally decided to get involved with Indradhanu this semester after a severe bout of FOMO (I am in my semi-final year at IIT Delhi, this is my 3rd to last semester, time does fly by so fast these days) prompted me to bridge the gap and engage with Indradhanu. The experience has been illuminating, to say the least. I have made good friends and discovered a whole new dimension of platonic male-female friendships. This personal journey leads me to reflect on the broader history of the LGBTQIA+ rights movement, notably the Stonewall Riots and the origins of Pride Month.

## A Timeline of the 1969 Uprising:

Looking back at the history of Pride, one cannot ignore the pivotal moment at the Stonewall Inn in 1969. This ignited the flame for queer activism and laid the foundation for Pride Month, celebrated annually in June.

**June 24, 1969:** Police arrest Stonewall employees.

On a summer night in 1969, the police raided the Stonewall Inn, a bar located in Greenwich Village of New York, which served as a safe haven for the city's gay, lesbian, and transgender communities. At that time, bars and restaurants could get shut down for serving gay customers or having gay staff. Police raids on gay bars were common, but on that particular night, members of the city's LGBTQ+ community fought back, sparking off an uprising that led to a new era of resistance.
