### The Rules

#### 4. Drain the Shallows

The shallow work that increasingly dominates the time and attention of knowledge workers is less vital than it often seems in the moment. 

Before diving into the details of these strategies, however, we should first confront the reality that there’s a limit to this anti-shallow thinking. The value of deep work vastly outweighs the value of shallow, but this doesn’t mean that you must quixotically pursue a schedule in which all of your time is invested in depth. For one thing, a nontrivial amount of shallow work is needed to maintain most knowledge work jobs. Then there’s the issue of cognitive capacity. Deep work is exhausting because it pushes you toward the limit of your abilities. 

Once you’ve hit your deep work limit in a given day, you’ll experience diminishing rewards if you try to cram in more. Shallow work, therefore, doesn’t become dangerous until after you add enough to begin to crowd out your bounded deep efforts for the day.
