### The Rules

#### 4. Drain the Shallows

The shallow work that increasingly dominates the time and attention of knowledge workers is less vital than it often seems in the moment. 

Before diving into the details of these strategies, however, we should first confront the reality that there's a limit to this anti-shallow thinking. The value of deep work vastly outweighs the value of shallow, but this doesn't mean that you must quixotically pursue a schedule in which all of your time is invested in depth. For one thing, a nontrivial amount of shallow work is needed to maintain most knowledge work jobs. Then there's the issue of cognitive capacity. Deep work is exhausting because it pushes you toward the limit of your abilities. 

Once you've hit your deep work limit in a given day, you'll experience diminishing rewards if you try to cram in more. Shallow work, therefore, doesn't become dangerous until after you add enough to begin to crowd out your bounded deep efforts for the day. 

##### 1. Schedule Every Minute of Your Day

We spend much of our day on autopilot - not giving much thought to what we're doing with our time. This is a problem. It's difficult to prevent the trivial from creeping into every corner of your schedule if you don't face, without flinching, your current balance between deep and shallow work, and then adopt the habit of pausing before action and asking, "What makes the most sense right now?"

Here's my suggestion: At the beginning of each workday, turn to a new page of lined paper in a notebook you dedicate to this purpose. Down the left-hand side of the page, mark every other line with an hour of the day, covering the full set of hours you typically work. Divide the hours of your workday into blocks and assign activities to the blocks.

Not every block need be dedicated to a work task. There might be time blocks for lunch or relaxation breaks. To keep things reasonably clean, the minimum length of a block should be thirty minutes (i.e., one line on your page). 

It's here, of course, that most people will begin to run into trouble. Two things can (and likely will) go wrong with your schedule once the day progresses. The first is that your estimates will prove wrong. You might put aside two hours for writing a press release, for example, and in reality it takes two and a half hours. The second problem is that you'll be interrupted and new obligations will unexpectedly appear on your plate. These events will also break your schedule.

If your schedule is disrupted, you should, at the next available moment, take a few minutes to create a revised schedule for the time that remains in the day. You can turn to a new page. You can erase and redraw blocks.

On some days, you might rewrite your schedule half a dozen times. Don't despair if this happens. Your goal is not to stick to a given schedule at all costs; it's instead to maintain, at all times, a thoughtful say in what you're doing with your time going forward - even if these decisions are reworked again and again as the day unfolds.

There are a few tactics that can inject some more stability. First, you should recognize that almost definitely you're going to underestimate at first how much time you require for most things. When people are new to this habit, they tend to use their schedule as an incarnation of wishful thinking - a best-case scenario for their day. 

The second tactic that helps is the use of overflow conditional blocks. If you're not sure how long a given activity might take, block off the expected time, then follow this with an additional block that has a split purpose. If you need more time for the preceding activity, use this additional block to keep working on it. If you finish the activity on time, however, have an alternate use already assigned for the extra block (for example, some non-urgent tasks). This allows unpredictability in your day without requiring you to keep changing your schedule on paper.

The third tactic I suggest is to be liberal with your use of task blocks. Deploy many throughout your day and make them longer than required to handle the tasks you plan in the morning.

"_I think you far understate the role of uncertaintyâ€¦ I [worry about] readers applying these observations too seriously, to the point of an obsessive (and unhealthy) relationship with one's schedule that seems to exaggerate the importance of minute-counting over getting-lost-in-activities, which if we're talking about artists is often the only really sensible course of action._"

The goal of a schedule is to force your behavior into a rigid plan. This type of scheduling, however, isn't about constraint - it's instead about thoughtfulness. It's a simple habit that forces you to continually take a moment throughout your day and ask: "What makes sense for me to do with the time that remains?" 

Without structure, it's easy to allow your time to devolve into the shallow - email, social media, Web surfing. This type of shallow behavior, though satisfying in the moment, is not conducive to creativity. With structure, on the other hand, you can ensure that you regularly schedule blocks to grapple with a new idea, or work deeply on something challenging, or brainstorm for a fixed period - the type of commitment more likely to instigate innovation. 

The motivation for this strategy is the recognition that a deep work habit requires you to treat your time with respect.
