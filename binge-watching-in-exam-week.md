# Confessions of a Chronic Binge-watcher
## 03/03/2024

Procrastination – the art of delaying the task at hand till the absolute last minute. As a self-proclaimed connoisseur of this fine art, I've painstakingly perfected the craft and taken it to new heights, especially when it comes to my addiction to binge-watching crime shows during exam season.

It all starts normally enough. There I am, sitting at my desk, surrounded by textbooks and notes, ready to conquer the world (or at least my upcoming exams). But then, like a siren's call from the depths of the internet, I hear it – the enticing call of the urge to take a break (after 15 minutes of study). And just like that, my fate is sealed.

Just 1 episode, I tell myself as I recline back on the bed under the covers. I know from decades (okay, years) of experience that I do not possess the self control to stop after just 1 episode. 

5 episodes later, instead of diving headfirst into my studies like any responsible student would, I find myself sinking deeper and deeper into the abyss of binge-watching bliss. Hours fly by in the blink of an eye as I become engrossed in the thrilling adventures of fictional detectives and forensic experts. Who needs to memorize chemical equations when you can watch Dexter Morgan dissect his latest victim?

Of course, my descent into procrastination doesn't go unnoticed by those around me. Friends shake their heads in dismay as they witness my transformation from diligent student to full-fledged couch potato. "You should be studying," they say. "You have exams this week," they remind me. But little do they know, I'm too busy trying to figure out whodunit in the latest episode of "CSI: Campus Edition" to care.

And let's not forget the ingenious excuses I come up with to justify my procrastination. "I'm just taking a short break," I tell myself as I settle in for yet another episode. "It's important to relax and unwind during stressful times," I rationalize, conveniently ignoring the fact that my stress levels are directly proportional to the number of episodes I watch.

But perhaps the most entertaining aspect of my procrastination is the lengths I'll go to in order to avoid facing reality. Suddenly, cleaning my room becomes a matter of utmost importance. Organizing my sock drawer takes on a newfound urgency. Heck, I'll even consider doing my laundry – anything to avoid cracking open those textbooks and facing the harsh reality of impending exams.

And let's not even talk about the sheer panic that sets in when I realize just how much time I've wasted. With each passing hour spent binge-watching crime shows, the weight of impending doom grows heavier and heavier until it feels like I'm suffocating under the crushing pressure of my own procrastination. But hey, at least I can solve fictional murders with the best of them, right?

In the end, my addiction to crime shows may not have helped me ace my exams, but it sure did provide some much-needed entertainment during those long, grueling study sessions. After all, why study for exams when you can watch someone else solve crimes on TV shows?

But despite the sleepless nights and the mounting pile of unread textbooks, I wouldn't trade my crime show addiction for anything in the world. Because let's face it, there's something undeniably exhilarating about watching detectives solve complex mysteries in the span of an hour, even if it means sacrificing a few precious hours of sleep (and sanity, which is already scarce these days) in the process.

In the end, I learn a valuable lesson (and forget it before the next exam): moderation is key, especially when it comes to indulging in guilty pleasures during exam season. Sure, 1 episode here and there can provide a much-needed escape from the stresses of studying, but there comes a point when you have to put down the (metaphorical) remote and pick up the textbooks.
