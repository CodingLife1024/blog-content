# Deep Work: Notes and Takeaways
## 19/03/2025

As a final-year CSE student drowning in assignments, projects, and coursework, I keep feeling like I'm working all the time but not getting as much done as I should. That's why I picked up "Deep Work" by Cal Newport - to figure out how to get more out of my work hours so I can actually have some time for myself.

### The Rules

#### 1. Work Deeply

"The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add _routines_ and _rituals_ to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration. If you suddenly decide, for example, in the middle of a distracted afternoon spent Web browsing, to switch your attention to a cognitively demanding task, you'll draw heavily from your finite willpower to wrest your attention away from the online shininess."

##### 1. Decide on your Depth Philosophy

1. **The Monsatic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling** - 

This Philosophy attempts to mazimize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations. This approach is best suited for those whose work thrives on long, uninterrupted stretches of deep focus, like writers, researchers, or theoretical scientists. This works for individuals who can work towards clear goals without other obligations that come with being a member of a larger organization.

2. **The Bimodal Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling** - 

This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined srtetches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else. During the deep time, the bimodal worker will act monastically - seeking intense and uninterrupted concentration. During the shallow time, such focus is not prioritized.  The bimodal philosophy believes that deep work can produce extreme productivity, but only if the subject dedicates enough time to such endeavors to reach maximum cognitive intensity - the state in which real breakthroughs occur. This is why the minimum unit of time for deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least one full day. 

3. **The Rhythmic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling** - 

This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit. The goal, in other words, is to generate a rhythm for this work that removes the need for you to invest energy in deciding if and when you're going to go deep. The chain method is a good example of the rhythmic philosophy of deep work scheduling because it combines a simple scheduling heuristic (do the work every day), with an easy way to remind yourself to do the work: the big red Xs on the calendar.

Another common way to implement the rhythmic philosophy is to replace the visual aid of the chain method with a set starting time that you use every day for deep work. In much the same way that maintaining visual indicators of your work progress can reduce the barrier to entry for going deep, eliminating even the simplest scheduling decisions, such as when during the day to do the work, also reduces this barrier.

The rhythmic philosophy provides an interesting contrast to the bimodal philosophy. It perhaps fails to achieve the most intense levels of deep thinking sought in the daylong concentration sessions favored by the bimodalist. The trade - off, however, is that this approach works better with the reality of human nature. By supporting deep work with rock-solid routines that make sure a little bit gets done on a regular basis, the rhythmic scheduler will often log a larger total number of deep hours per year.

4. **The Journalistic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling** - 

This philosophy involves switching into deep work mode whenever possible, fitting focused sessions into a schedule filled with other obligations. It requires the ability to shift gears quickly and dive into cognitively demanding work, even in short bursts. This approach is inspired by journalists, who must produce high-quality writing on tight deadlines despite unpredictable schedules.

This approach is not for the deep work novice. As I established in the opening to this rule, the ability to rapidly switch your mind from shallow to deep mode doesn't come naturally. Without practice, such switches can seriously deplete your finite willpower reserves. This habit also requires a sense of confidence in your abilities - a conviction that what you're doing is important and will succeed. This type of conviction is typically built on a foundation of existing professional accomplishment.

#### 2. Ritualize

This strategy suggests the following: To make the most out of your deep work sessions, build rituals of the a level of strictness and idiosyncrasy. There's a good reason for this mimicry. Great minds did so because success in their work depended on their ability to go deep, again and again. Their rituals minimized the friction in this transition to depth, allowing them to go deep more easily and stay in the state longer. If they had instead waited for inspiration to strike before settling in to serious work, their accomplishments would likely have been greatly reduced.

There are some general questions that any effective ritual must address: 

1. **Where you'll work and for how long** - Your ritual needs to specify a location for your deep work efforts.

2. **How you'll work once you start to work** - Your ritual needs rules and processes to keep your efforts structured. For example, you might institute a ban on any Internet use, or maintain a metric such as words produced per twenty-minute interval to keep your concentration honed. Without this structure, you'll have to mentally litigate again and again what you should and should not be doing during these sessions and keep trying to assess whether you're working sufficiently hard. These are unnecessary drains on your willpower reserves.

3. **How you'll support your work** - Your ritual needs to ensure your brain gets the support it needs to keep operating at a high level of depth. For example, the ritual might specify that you start with a cup of coffee.

#### 3. Make Grand Gestures

By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task. This boost in importance reduces your mind's instinct to procrastinate and delivers an injection of motivation and energy.

#### 4. Don't Work Alone

We can, therefore, still dismiss the depth-destroying open office concept without dismissing the innovation-producing theory of serendipitous creativity. The key is to maintain both in a hub-and-spoke-style arrangement: Expose yourself to ideas in hubs on a regular basis, but maintain a spoke in which to work deeply on what you encounter.

For some types of problems, working with someone else at the proverbial shared whiteboard can push you deeper than if you were working alone. The presence of the other party waiting for your next insight - be it someone physically in the same room or collaborating with you virtually - can short-circuit the natural instinct to avoid depth.

#### 5. Execute Like a Business

This division between what and how is crucial but is overlooked in the professional world. It's often straightforward to identify a strategy needed to achieve a goal, but what trips up companies is figuring out how to execute the strategy once identified.

<u>Discipline #1: Focus on the Wildly Important</u> - As the authors of The 4 Disciplines of Execution explain, "The more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish." They elaborate that execution should be aimed at a small number of "wildly important goals." This simplicity will help focus an organization's energy to a sufficient intensity to ignite real results.

<u>Discipline #2: Act on the Lead Measures</u> - Once you've identified a wildly important goal, you need to measure your success. In 4DX, there are two types of metrics for this purpose: lag measures and lead measures. Lag measures describe the thing you're ultimately trying to improve. Lead measures, on the other hand, "measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures." For an individual focused on deep work, it's easy to identify the relevant lead measure: time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal. 

<u>Discipline #3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard</u> - "People play differently when they're keeping score," the 4DX authors explain. They then elaborate that when attempting to drive your team's engagement toward your organization's wildly important goal, it's important that they have a public place to record and track their lead measures. This scoreboard creates a sense of competition that drives them to focus on these measures, even when other demands vie for their attention. It also provides a reinforcing source of motivation. 

<u>Discipline #4: Create a Cadence of Accountability</u> - The 4DX authors elaborate that the final step to help maintain a focus on lead measures is to put in place "a rhythm of regular and frequent meetings of any team that owns a wildly important goal." During these meetings, the team members must confront their scoreboard, commit to specific actions to help improve the score before the next meeting, and describe what happened with the commitments they made at the last meeting. They note that this review can be condensed to only a few minutes, but it must be regular for its effect to be felt. The authors argue that it's this discipline where "execution really happens." For an individual focused on his or her own deep work habit, there's likely no team to meet with, but this doesn't exempt you from the need for regular accountability. 

The 4DX framework is based on the fundamental premise that execution is more difficult than strategizing. After hundreds and hundreds of case studies, its  managed to isolate a few basic disciplines that seem to work particularly well in conquering this difficulty. 

#### 6. Be Lazy

"_Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable to the brain as vitamin D is to the body, and deprived of it we suffer a mental affliction as disfiguring as rickets...it is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done._"

This strategy argues that you should inject regular and substantial freedom from professional concerns into your day, providing you with the idleness paradoxically required to get (deep) work done. There are many ways to accomplish this goal. Instead, I want to suggest a more applicable but still quite powerful heuristic: At the end of the workday, shut down your consideration of work issues until the next morning—no after-dinner e-mail check, no mental replays of conversations, and no scheming about how you'll handle an upcoming challenge; shut down work thinking completely. If you need more time, then extend your workday, but once you shut down, your mind must be left free.

"_The scientific literature has emphasized the benefits of conscious deliberation in decision making for hundreds of years...The question addressed here is whether this view is justified. We hypothesize that it is not._"

**Unconscious Thought Theory (UTT)** - At a high level, this theory proposes that for decisions that require the application of strict rules, the conscious mind must be involved. On the other hand, for decisions that involve large amounts of information and multiple vague, and perhaps even conflicting, constraints, your unconscious mind is well suited to tackle the issue. UTT hypothesizes that this is due to the fact that these regions of your brain have more neuronal bandwidth available, allowing them to move around more information and sift through more potential solutions than your conscious centers of thinking. The implication of this line of research is that providing your conscious brain time to rest enables your unconscious mind to take a shift sorting through your most complex professional challenges. 

A shutdown habit, therefore, is not necessarily reducing the amount of time you're engaged in productive work, but is instead diversifying the type of work you deploy.
